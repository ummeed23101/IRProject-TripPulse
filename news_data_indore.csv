A video of the purported incident that occurred during the Holi celebrations also surfaced on social media. “On Monday, four women forcibly pulled the victim out of her house, beat her up and humiliated her by stripping her naked in public at Bachhora village of Gautampura police station area,” Superintendent of Police (Rural) Sunil Mehta said. All four accused women were later arrested, he said. Mr. Mehta visited the village on Wednesday and said peace prevails there now. But as the victim is disturbed due to her humiliation, she has gone to her parents' home, he said. One of the accused suspected that the victim was instigating her mother-in-law against her. She also suspected that the victim had taken her mother-in-law to Mandsaur without informing her, the police official said. According to him, some onlookers in the village shot video of the humiliating act and circulated it. These people are being identified and appropriate legal steps will be taken against them, he said. Eyewitnesses said the accused women dragged the victim out of her house and stripped her. They said that the victim woman kept pleading for mercy at the time of the incident, but the accused did not relent and they openly stripped her by tearing her clothes. They also took her to some distance on the common road of the village in the same condition. A police officer said that a case has been registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354-A (sexual harassment) and 452 (wrongfully restraining and assaulting).

uptick in power usage, with estimates indicating a potential...",2 days ago,Free Press Journal,"Indore (Madhya Pradesh): As there is a significant correlation between the rising heat and surging electricity consumption, Madhya Pradesh West Zone Electricity Distribution Company has anticipated that the potential peak of power consumption will be 700 MW if the mercury climbs to 43-45 degrees Celsius. With each degree increase in temperature, the city witnesses a substantial uptick in power usage, with estimates indicating a potential spike of five lakh units for every one-degree rise, said West Discom. Data from the past 25 days of March reveals a marked increase in electricity consumption compared to the same period last year, signalling a trend likely to persist as summer intensifies. Presently, the city's daily electricity demand hovers around 470 MW, with consumption nearing 95 lakh units. As the mercury soars, the city braces for a surge in cooling-related appliance usage, including air conditioners, fans, coolers, and refrigerators. As per West Discom’s estimates, about 2.5 lakh air conditioners, 20 lakh fans, 3.5 lakh coolers and about 5.5 lakh fridges are used in the city during summer. With the onset of summer vacation for schoolchildren, domestic consumption is expected to soar further. Electricity officials estimate that if the temperature is 39 degrees, the daily consumption of power can reach 1 crore to 1.02 crore units. The consumption will be 1.08 crore units and 1.14 crore units if the temperature is 40 degrees and 41 degrees respectively, they projected. According to the electricity demand, it can cross 520 MW on April 5, 540 MW on April 10, 570 MW on April 25 and 625 MW on May 15. If the mercury climbs to 43-45 degrees Celsius, the city could witness a record demand of up to 700 MW, surpassing previous years' peaks. To meet the anticipated surge, West Discom officials have ramped up preparations, aligning resources to accommodate a maximum demand of 700 MW. Last year's peak demand of 630 MW, recorded on June 14, serves as a benchmark for this year's projections. With power consumption closely tied to rising temperatures, Indore remains vigilant as it readies itself to navigate potential energy challenges amid the sweltering summer months ahead.

Come July, the students enrolled for MOOCs and other digital courses can now take exams in pen-and-paper format at the university level also,” he told reporters. Nadda said that around 60 lakh students enrolled for MOOCs and other online courses but around 15 to 20 lakh students only register with NTA for exams. “The students generally feel comfortable with pen-and-paper format of exams whereas NTA holds exams in computer-based mode. It’s for the reason that we have asked the university and autonomous college to hold exams for MOCC students as well,” he stated. While NTA charges around Rs 600 per paper, the university will conduct exams for MOCC courses for free. Nadda stated that the central government has set a target to take the gross enrolment ratio (GER) from existing 27 per cent to 50 per cent by 2035. “There are roughly 1,200 universities and 45,000 colleges in the country. To double the GER, the government will have to ensure that the universities and colleges also double in the next 11 years, which is impossible to do. Hence, digital education is the only way forward,” he said. Dubbing it “an achievement”, Nadda said that 208 courses under Swayam scheme have been developed in the last two years.

They work for an Indore-based fleet services firm, ‘Sakha’ which means friend in Hindi. Ranjita is from Indore and mother of two - son (18) and a daughter (16). Sonam has got two sons. The two ladies are working as car drivers so as to feed their school going kids. Initially, it was not easy to venture into the driving job for them. “The moment my father came to know of my plan to become a professional driver, he got angry and started yelling at me,” says Sonam. However, both of them got an uninitiated support from their husbands which helped them realise their dream job of car driver. Ranjita, who hails from Indore and has lost her husband a few years ago, says, ""I often take families to distant places like Mahakaleshwar and Omkareshwar and often have to be out for 2-3 days."" Sonam, who hails from remote place like Nimar in Madhya Pradesh, had started her career by driving kachada collecting vehicle by the local civic body. However she didn't find it interesting enough and hence joined a fleet services providing firm some five years ago. When there is no advance booking in place, they drive their cars as Ola drivers. In fact, these women have set an example for others to follow. © Copyright 2024 | Powered by Hocalwire © Copyright 2022 | Powered by Hocalwire"

However, when organising film festivals one keeps in mind the possibility of triggering off a few of the audience members into deep thinking and moving in a new direction,” he said addressing the concluding day of the three-day educational film festival. The festival was organised by CEC at the Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya. Addressing the valedictory ceremony, environmentalist Padma Shri Bhalu Mondhe said that students should be taken into the jungles, wetlands etc to teach them about nature and how to observe nature. “Documentaries about environmental issues should be screened in towns and villages to create awareness and bring change,” he added. He said that land is being reclaimed for housing by destroying forests and filling up lakes and other water bodies. “The need of the hour is to now convert barren lands into water bodies to sustain the present and future need for water,” he added. He urged film-makers and students in the audience to make documentaries on social issues to focus light on them and create awareness among the citizens. Congratulating the awardees for their creations, DAVV Vice Chancellor Prof Renu Jain said that the documentaries were not just movies but were the sharing of knowledge through story-telling. “This is the best way possible to connect with learners,” she said. Mentioning the New Education Policy (NEP), she said that value-based knowledge and content-based knowledge could be given to the people through educational films. While registrar Ajay Verma said that DAVV is ready to host educational film festival in the future too, festival secretary Dr Chandan Gupta proposed the vote of thanks. Awards and citations were given in different categories to the 19 films that were screened during the festival."

All four accused women have been arrested. The pictures of the incident went viral on Wednesday, showing four village women tearing off the victim’s saree and blouse and dragging her brutally. Notably, the assault took place after the victim allegedly took one of the accused women's mother-in-law to Mandsaur without their family’s permission. According to the information, instead of intervening and helping the woman being assaulted, people present at the scene captured the incident. The Gautampura police took swift action upon receiving the information and arrested the four women, sending them to jail. Later, authorities instructed people to delete the videos from social media and their mobile phones. According to Rural ASP Sunil Kumar Mehta, the fight began when Lakshmi, accompanied by three other women, visited the victim's house and accused her of taking her mother-in-law to Mandsaur without permission. This led to a heated argument, culminating in the four women assaulting the victim inside her own home. The victim was dragged downstairs while being beaten, and her clothes were torn apart. The assailants mercilessly beat her with pipes and sticks, leaving her naked as they paraded her in the nearby area. The accused women had allegedly held a grudge against the victim for the past four months. Sub-Inspector Deepak Baghel said that the victim and the accused women belonged to different social circles, and the conflict arose from an incident where the victim had taken the accused woman's mother-in-law to Mandsaur. Gautampura Tehsildar Sangita Solanki stated that the dispute between the victim and the accused women revolved around the incident of taking the mother-in-law to Mandsaur. The accused women have been charged under serious sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354-A (sexual harassment) and 452 (wrongfully restraining and assaulting)."

Indore, Balaghat Voters Barely","Those who have so far been given tickets indicate that the party has tried 
to put up a little fight in some seats.",4 days ago,Free Press Journal,"Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh): The Congress has so far announced 22 candidates for 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state. As the Congress has given one seat to its alliance partner, the Samajwadi Party, it is yet to declare contestants for six more constituencies. Those who have so far been given tickets indicate that the party has tried to put up a little fight in some seats. But in a few constituencies, the Congress contenders seem weaker than their BJP counterparts. As many Congress candidates are confined only to their assembly seats, they are encountering a major problem – the voters in the Lok Sabha constituencies hardly recognise them. The candidates, like Arun Shrivastava (Bhopal), Akshay Kanti Bam (Indore), Samrat Saraswat (Balaghat), Guddu Raja Bundela (Sagar), Rajendra Malviya (Dewas), Porlal Kharte (Khargone), Pankaj Ahirwar (Tikamgarh) and Radheyshyam Muwel (Dhar), are among those Lok Sabha candidates considered weaker than their rivals. The Congress will put its strength behind these candidates. Some of these candidates were seeking tickets for the assembly election. But as their names did not figure in the survey conducted to select candidates for the assembly election, they were not made candidates. Apart from that, there were other political reasons for not giving them tickets. The voter-candidate gap The Congress has fielded them, for it lacked contestants for the Lok Sabha election, but the problem they are encountering is that they voters do not know them. Arun Shrivastava was president from rural area in Bhopal. He is well-known among the Congress workers in the rural area, but he does not have control over the partymen of the city unit. Bam is also facing the same problem. Before the assembly election he sought a ticket from the constituency number four in Indore, but he did not get it. Now he has been asked to contest the Lok Sabha election. The voters of Indore are not acquainted with him. Bundela, who is contesting from Sagar, is not a native of Madhya Pradesh. He wanted a ticket from the Khurai assembly constituency. Instead of giving him a ticket for the assembly election, Bundela has been asked to fight the Lok Sabha election. Saraswat is a member of the Balaghat district Panchayat. Once his father was an MLA. He has some popularity in the rural areas of Balaghat, but the urban voters are barely acquainted with him. Muwel, who has been given a ticket for the Lok Sabha election from Dhar, sought a ticket from the Manawar assembly constituency. Likewise, candidate for the Tikamgarh Lok Sabha constituency, Ahirwar, was seeking a ticket from Jatara assembly constituency. But because these three candidates were considered weak, they were not given tickets. Against this backdrop, the party may have to work harder for these candidates."
