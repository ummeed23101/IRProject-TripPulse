"Prediction for LSG (Lucknow Super Giants) vs PBKS (Punjab Kings) 30.03 
Indian Premier League","LSG 45% Chance of Winning PBKS 55% Parimatch Melbet Megapari T20 Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium Join Parimatch and start betting! After an underwhelming campaign last season, Punjab Kings started off their campaign with an impressive win against Delhi Capitals but in the last game they failed to defend a par score against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Punjab Kings bowlers had an underwhelming game as RCB won the game with four wickets to spare. After an impressive season last year, LSG were expected to have a solid campaign once again but stuttered in the opening game against Rajasthan Royals. LSG conceded 193 runs in the game as they eventually lost the game by 20 runs. As per our calculations, Punjab Kings are favourites in the upcoming game.

For both teams to do well this season they need their star players to bat well otherwise both sides could struggle this season. We expect this to be a fairly low scoring game and total runs would be below 346.5. As we have stated earlier we expect this to be a low scoring game but both sides have enough firepower to make a direct impact on the game. The bookmakers believe total boundaries would be around 39.5 which is too low as per our expectations. We believe total boundaries to be higher than 39.5. Most Fours: Punjab Kings Most Sixes: Punjab Kings Highest Opening Partnership: Lucknow Super Giants Historically the venue has favoured the team batting first. Last season, four of the six matches were won by teams who batted first which makes us believe both sides would prefer to bat first at the venue. With 5% chances of disruptions we believe climate would not play a major role in the game. Maximum temperature is expected to be 35C during the game and minimum temperature is expected to be 22C.

"LSG vs PBKS Playing 11, IPL 2024: Extra spinner for Lucknow, Stoinis 
remains; Bairstow in focus for Punjab","Lucknow Super Giants vs Punjab Kings Playing 11, IPL 2024: LSG will play their first home game of the IPL season in match 11 against PBKS at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Saturday. While Rahul’s men have started with a defeat, Dhawan’s Punjab have witnessed see-sawing fortunes already with a win and a defeat to Royal Challengers Bengaluru away. A return to Lucknow will prove to be tricky for the home side as well as the visitors with the sluggish nature of the track setting up a test of the skills and composition of both teams. READ: KL Rahul has a strike rate problem Extra spinner in for Lucknow? LSG will have quality spinners in Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi at their disposal in the XI. But with a couple of left-handers in the opposition batting order and the slow nature of the Lucknow strips, Lucknow may add an off-spinner into the XI. K Gowtham could get a nod with one of the local batters featuring as an Impact Player. Stonis to retain spot With his form hitting rock bottom, Marcus Stoinis has also witnessed a snub from Australia’s central contracts for the upcoming season. However, the sturdy all-rounder could be explosive on his day and will continue to play an important part in LSG’s combinations. LSG predicted XI: KL Rahul (c), Quinton de Kock, Devdutt Padikkal, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, Krunal Pandya, Marcus Stoinis, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur. Impact Player: Ayush Badoni/K. Gowtham Raza for Bairstow? Opening for Punjab, Jonny Bairstow has failed to click in both games, scoring 9 and 8 respectively. Instead, PBKS could bring in an extra spinner-allrounder in Sikandar Raza to replace Bairstow for this particular contest, adding strength to the middle-order. Prabhsimran Singh could move up the order to replace Bairstow as captain Dhawan’s opening partner. PBKS predicted XI: Shikhar Dhawan (c), Prabhsimran Singh, Sikandar Raza, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Shashank Singh, Harpreet Brar, Kagiso Rabada, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar.

Sehri during holy month of Ramzan: A divine meal before dawn!,"Subscribe Now! Get features like The ritual of sehri (pre-dawn meal), be it at home dastarkhwan or a food joint table in the Old City brings along a whole some meal before the fajr (morning) prayers and sets the stage for a long fast ahead. Sehri, also known as Suhur, has a religious and cultural significance during the holy month of Ramzan. We find out where and how the city folks are keeping up with the tradition. Joints that are functionable for sehri purpose are witnessing a good turnout of rozedars till wee hours. “At our new joint, opposite Chota Imambada, we have introduced qeema-poori, aloo-poori and the hot favourite being halwa-poori that remains the best pick for all. Our novelty item crispy chicken with a cup of masala chai still rules for both old and young set of rozedars for sehri,” says Wamesh Cafe owner Sheeraz Manzar. For some, sehri is about celebrating togetherness. “Iftar functions are held at several places but sehri get-togethers are becoming the trend of the day. Unlike iftar, it’s not a social affair but close relatives and friends do come over or invite sehri. Otherwise, it’s more about being with family for the first meal,” says businessman Sufiyan Siddiqui, who is planning a sehri get-together during the weekend. Healthy food, which comprises fibers, carbs, protein and water are preferred before fasting which keeps rozedars hydrated during the day. “Just before Ramzan, we revamped our menu and added a few items for sehri and iftar (evening meal to break the fast). What people prefer for sehri is very different. It’s much more on the healthier side — easy to digest and less in quantity. Placed in Hazratganj, we close at 12am, but our home delivery continues till sehri during Ramzan. Shakes, fresh juices, summer salads and baked vegetable platters are high in demand for sehri,” informs Sicily Cafe owner Saif Saleem. Working at a heritage hotel in Lucknow, Chef Mohsin Qureshi enjoys his midnight outings with his gang of friends throughout Ramazan. “A bike ride to Old City heritage locations, Kashmiri chai and sehri at Akbari Gate is a routine in Ramzan. We try different dishes every time and the best ones are often repeated. So, after sehri with friends we reach home and have a quick bite with family before heading for prayers to start the fast,” says Qureshi.

Lucknow Police to get mobile drone vehicles,"Way of the Cross Lucknow, March 27 (IANS): The new hi-tech Mobile Drone Vehicle (MDV) will soon join the Lucknow Police to make policing more effective. The flying time of this drone will be 10-15 hours, some leap from the present 15 minutes. The new MDV serves both as its base and carries the drone, allowing for remote monitoring. It is ready to be used as it can be installed within a few minutes. The drone has a 10-hour flight duration as opposed to the typical drone with a 15 to 20-minute flying limit. Upendra Kumar Agrawal, Joint Commissioner of Police (JCP), Law and Order, said: “We did a trial run and it was successful. We are in the final stage to launch it, where big events such as processions, cricket matches, and upcoming Lok Sabha elections can be monitored.” The drone has been developed by a city-based Robotic company Roboz run by a robot expert Milind Raj and is being funded by Goenka Group under its corporate social responsibility programme. “Continuous monitoring will be done through the drone installed in this vehicle. It will continue to get battery backup through a wire and a generator in the vehicle. Till now, only 10-15 minutes of monitoring has been possible through drones,” added the JCP. “A 32-inch screen in the car will help the team sitting inside the vehicle monitor captured proceedings. Interestingly, the drone will be able to keep an eye from a height of about 70 feet. Till now, drones can take good pictures only from a maximum height of 20 feet,” he said adding that the drone will be significant to keep a watch on sensitive programmes. Agarwal said that the drone system can be fed criminal data from police records and can be used to scan for criminals who may be present at such events. “The device will be useful for managing traffic since, in the event of a jam, a parked drone in the vicinity may fly to identify the cause of the jam, eliminating the need for a traffic cop to investigate,” said the JCP.

registration time","Subscribe Now! Get features like The Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) on Tuesday extended the deadline for registration of PM Awas houses till March 31 for residents of Akbar Nagar who have already started vacating their premises. The Lucknow high court has set March 31 deadline for the BPL card holders of Akbar Nagar to vacate their houses after which the development authority will demolish illegal houses of slum dwellers. With only five days left for the high court’s deadline and none having approached Supreme Court against HC order, the residents of Akbar Nagar have accepted the inevitable and started vacating their premises. The development authority has also handed over possession of PM Awas at Hardoi Road to around 40 residents of Akbar Nagar who have vacated their premises. Some of them have expressed their inability to opt for residence under PM Awas scheme. “I work as a helper at a Badshahnagar shop and can’t shift to a location several kilometers away from Akbar Nagar. So, I have shifted to a rented accommodation at Luv Kush Nagar,” said Adil Ali, an Akbar Nagar resident. Around 1,200 houses in Akbar Nagar are facing the development authority’s demolition axe, and the high court was almost their last hope as the court had earlier stayed the demolition drive for BPL card holders of Akbar Nagar till further orders. “As there is no option left, residents of Akbar Nagar have started relocating to other locations,” said Mohammad Kafil, resident of Akbar Nagar. Several residents have shifted to rented accommodations at nearby Sarvodya Nagar and Luv Kush Nagar.

Feeder separation: Farmers to get fixed 10-hour power supply for tubewells,"Subscribe Now! Get features like Lucknow: Farmers in Uttar Pradesh may soon start getting power supply for fixed 10 hours in the daytime to operate their tubewells, once all the feeders in the state are segregated into agricultural and domestic categories, dedicating agricultural feeders to the irrigation pump sets. The UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL), according to the people in the know of things, has asked discoms to necessarily separate all the remaining feeders by April 15. Currently, power supply to agricultural and domestic consumers is made through common feeders because of which fubewells also get electricity supply for longer hours resulting in wastage of power by farmers and overloading of system at peak time. Under the feeder separation scheme being funded by the Centre, agricultural consumers are supposed to get quality power only for 8-10 hours a day instead of being served continuously. More than 2,800 of the total 4,264 feeders in UP have already been separated and around 1,500 feeders, 151 in Varanasi discom, 112 in Lucknow discom, 218 in in Agra discom and 577 in Meerut discom are yet to be segregated. The remaining feeders are being segregated under the Centre’s new and ongoing Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS). “UPPCL chairman Ashish Kumar Goyel told discoms to give top priority to feeder separation work under the RDSS, segregating all the feeders by April 15,” a senior UPPCL official said. “The deadline is, however, not practical as it may take more time for the work to be completed,” he added. The segregation feeders, he said, would make it possible to provide electricity to farmers for limited hours in the day to meet their irrigation requirement. “Doing so will enable the UPPCL to shift the peak load to daytime and also save farmers from snakebite incidents they often encounter because of irrigating their fields in the night,” the official pointed out. In UP, there are 14.60 lakh agricultural tubewells and they together consume over 20% of the state’s electricity, surpassing industries and ranking as the second-biggest power guzzler after the domestic sector in the state.

Gold worth over ₹66 lakh seized at Lucknow airport,"Subscribe Now! Get features like The Customs Department seized gold worth ₹66.93 lakh from a passenger on a flight arriving from Bangkok at Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport in Lucknow on Sunday. The Customs Department has confirmed the seizure; but the details regarding the modus operandi of smuggling remain undisclosed. An official of Lucknow airport on condition of anonymity said, “The surge in gold smuggling at Lucknow Airport is accompanied by a parallel increase in the smuggling of cigarettes. There has been a rise in seizures, with goods worth crores of rupees confiscated monthly. In the past month alone, seizures amounting to ₹4.16 crore have been recorded, indicating the scale of the issue.” The official said, “Smuggling techniques vary, with smugglers resorting to ingenious methods to evade detection. From concealing gold within the handles of coffee machines and trolley bags to resorting to more invasive measures such as hiding gold in the rectum, smugglers employ a range of tactics.” Despite stringent vigilance measures, gold smuggling is becoming a big challenge at Lucknow Airport. The officials acknowledge that only a fraction, estimated at 10 to 15 percent, of the smuggled gold is intercepted. The official said, “Smugglers continue to innovate, exploiting various avenues such as concealing gold within clothing, electrical appliances, and even within the soles of shoes or elastic bands of underwear.

Here's everything you need to know about the IPL records in this venue. MORE: Who will make the India squad for 2024 T20 World Cup? EXCLUSIVE IPL BONUSES AND OFFERS Ekana Cricket Stadium has hosted seven IPL matches. It hosted all seven LSG home games last season, although one game had no result. The team batting first won four times while the team batting second won on two occasions. This pitch is just like any other in the Indian Premier League; it favors hitters and gives bowlers very little. Slower bowlers (especially spinners), however, might benefit from it in some way. Last year, the team that batted second won just twice, which shows that the pitch becomes more difficult to bat on as the game progresses. The captain that wins the toss might opt to bat first. The Super Giants have won three out of the six matches they have played at this venue. They have a 50% win percentage at this stadium. The highest score in an innings at the venue is 193-6, which was posted by LSG against Delhi Capitals in 2023 while batting first. Kyle Mayers was the top scorer for the home team, scoring 73 off 38 balls. The lowest total recorded at the Ekana Cricket Stadium is 108, registered by LSG against RCB in 2023.

The average first-innings score in completed games at this venue is 129, while the average first-innings winning score is 158.

And Holi, the festival of colours the other day – I haven’t had so much fun since I was about three years old.” Looking back at his team’s disappointing start to the campaign (the 20-run defeat to Rajasthan Royals), the former Australian opener and coach said he was glad the first game was out of the way. “Now we are looking forward to our first home game and hoping to make it a dominant place for LSG this summer,” he said. “And I found that every game is won by the home side this IPL.” Langer isn’t bothered about the talk about LSG captain K.L. Rahul’s strike-rate. “I am not going to lose one second’s sleep over Rahul,” he said. “He is a beautiful player.” Punjab Kings’ spin-bowling coach Sunil Joshi said he would advise his players about the pitch, which he is familiar with thanks to his stint as Uttar Pradesh coach. “I will tell the bowlers where there are good pockets to bowl on,” he said.

"Abducted boy dies, UP police shoot eight accused in leg","A DAY after the body of a jeweller’s 12-year-old son, who was kidnapped from Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh, was found in Delhi, all eight abductors were arrested Monday after being shot in the leg in an encounter, police said. The accused are currently undergoing treatment for their gunshot wounds in a hospital. Doctors said their condition was stable. According to the police, Subhan, a class 6 student, was abducted from outside his home in Erwa Katra area of Auraiya on Saturday. Auraiya SP Charu Nigam said those arrested included Riyaz Siddiqui, a neighbour of the victim, who planned the kidnapping for ransom. They have confessed to the crime. After kidnapping the boy, the accused, all in their 20s, hid him in a trolley bag in which he suffocated to death, said Auraiya Circle Officer Ashok Singh. He said that hours after the boy went missing while playing outside their residence, his father Mohammad Shakeel, a jeweller in Auraiya, filed a complaint with Erwa Katra Police Station Saturday night. During preliminary investigations, the police found that Subhan was last seen with the neighbor Riyaz Siddiqui. Locals also told the police that Riyaz was seen with the boy frequently in recent days. When the police looked for Riyaz and his friends, they could not be traced. The police then obtained their call records, which showed their movement out of Auraiya. Multiple police teams were deployed to track them. Later, the police found their location in the National Capital Region. The Auraiya police said that with assistance from Noida and Delhi police, one of the accused, Awadesh Kumar Mishra, was caught on Sunday. He revealed that the boy was with three other associates – Jatin Deewakar, Ravi Kumar, and Deepak Gupta – near Paschim Vihar in Delhi. Working with the Delhi police, the Auraiya police nabbed Jatin, Ravi and Deepak. On their information, the police recovered a trolley bag from their car. When the bag was opened, they found Subhan’s body, with hands and legs tied with a rope, said a police officer. The boy was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Following legal procedures in Delhi, the arrested four accused were taken back to Auraiya. They confessed to the involvement of Riyaz and three of his associates – Shobhan Yadav, Ankit Kumar, and Ashish Mishra – in the crime and said that they were still in Auraiya. Awadesh told the police that their plan was to collect the ransom from the boy’s family at the Baukhera thickets in Auraiya. To nab Riyaz and his three associates, the police laid a trap. They asked the arrested accused to call Riyaz and others to collect the ransom from them. “When Riyaz, Shobhan, Ankit and Ashish arrived at the spot they opened fire on the police team. Taking advantage of the situation, Awadesh, Jatin, Ravi and Deepak, who were arrested in Delhi, tried to escape. In the firing, all eight accused sustained bullet injuries in their legs and were caught,” said a",2

"All eyes on Lucknow's surface as LSG look for first win | Indian Premier 
League, 2024","The last time Lucknow Super Giants and Punjab Kings played against each other, almost 460 runs were scored in the match. KL Rahul and his men amassed 257 in the first innings and in response, Punjab also crossed the 200-run mark. It was a proper run-fest, but all this happened in Mohali. This match on March 30 is in Lucknow, which was the worst venue for batters last season. So, there will be a lot of focus on the surface when the two teams step out on Saturday. Lucknow started the season with a 20-run defeat against Rajasthan Royals on 24 (Sunday) and haven’t played since then. There were a couple of good individual performances but they failed to click as a unit. Meanwhile, PBKS toppled Delhi Capitals in their first game but lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru despite being in a commanding position for the majority of the game. LSG vs PBKS Head-to-Head Overall - Games 3 | LSG 2 | PBKS 1 In Lucknow - Games 1 | LSG 0 | PBKS 1 Venue details The batters struggled big time at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in IPL 2023. The scoring rate of 7.4, average of 20.6 and balls/dismissal of 16.8 were the worst amongst all venues. Only four 160-plus totals were registered in seven games. The surfaces were on the slower and lower side and offered a lot of assistance to spinners, who went about their business at an average of 20.4 and an economy of 6.7. The numbers for fast bowlers were also not too bad - 22.9 and 7.8 respectively. LSG head coach Justin Langer had suggested before the season that the pitches will be better this time around. “We've done a lot of work here on the pitches. At the end of last season, they changed the soil on the pitches, and we saw some good results in the World Cup. They played a few games here. There were some high-scoring games.” Weather forecast We are sure to have a full game in Lucknow. The temperature is expected to be around 32-33 degrees Celsius at the start but could go down to as low as 27 at some point. The humidity will be in the range of 50-70 percent. Things to watch out for Dhawan’s strike rate is a concern Punjab got 176 against Bengaluru and lost the game in the final over. Howbeit, they could have probably gotten a bit more if skipper Shikhar Dhawan hadn’t wasted 37 deliveries for his 45 runs. In the powerplay, the left-handed opener scored 21 off as many deliveries as Punjab could only get 40 runs in the first phase. Dhawan had a strike rate of less than 120 in the 2021 and 2022 editions but got it up to 137.1 in IPL 2023. But at the same time, his average dropped to 26.5, compared to 40+ in 2021 and 2022. He has mostly struggled against spin in IPL since 2022, averaging 25.3 while striking at 123.41, compared",1

"Lucknow to have over 3.7K booths; citizens aged 85 and above can opt for 
vote-from-home facility","Subscribe Now! Get features like LUCKNOW As Lucknow braces for the ‘celebration of democracy’, the district administration is working towards equipping all polling booths with key facilities like drinking water, children’s playing area, wheelchairs and toilets to cover every voter, especially the elderly and women. “The administration has meticulously planned to set up polling stations to ensure equitable access to polling across various constituencies,” said Suryapal Gangwar, district electoral officer. Citizens aged 85 years and above can access form 12D on the Election Commission of India website to request postal ballots at home, he said, adding: “Within five days of form issuance, booth level officers (BLOs) will pay a visit to assist in filling the form. Previously, this facility was for voters aged 80 and above.” Form 12D is accessible on the ECI website’s homepage under ‘candidate nomination and other forms’. This initiative aims to facilitate senior citizens by enabling them to vote from home. Sarojini Nagar constituency leads with 582 booths, followed by BKT 487, Lucknow East 417, Lucknow West 414, Malihabad 405, Mohanlalganj 399, Lucknow North 393 and Lucknow Central 339 booths. Notably, Lucknow Cantt has the least number of 330 booths allocated for voters participating in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. Compared to the previous elections, the number of voters has surged by 1.49 lakh. In 2022 assembly elections, Lucknow boasted of 4062 booths, but at that time the elections were held under Covid scare and social distancing was a norm. However, during the Lok Sabha polls in 2024, the district administration has planned 3767 booths, marking a notable reduction of 295 booths. District magistrate Suryapal Gangwar said unlike the previous polls, where strict Covid protocols were enforced due to rapid spread of Omicron variant, this time around, no such guidelines are applicable. During the last elections, the Election Commission mandated a cap of 1200 voters per booth, leading to an increase in the number of booths to accommodate the rising voter turnout. However, with the situation now different, the maximum number of voters per booth has been fixed at 1500, resulting in a reduction in the number of booths compared to 2022. During the previous Vidhan Sabha elections, the total number of voters stood at 38,04,114, but now (Lok Sabha elections) the figure has climbed to 39,53,287, indicating a substantial increase of 1,49,173 voters in Lucknow. This year, 14 polling stations have been established in high-rise buildings. According to Gangwar, this decision has been taken due to the rapid expansion of the city and the population residing in newly constructed apartments. A special campaign was launched to include these residents on the voter list to ensure inclusivity and accessibility in the electoral process.",0

Teen detained for ‘plotting father’s murder’,"TWO DAYS after a 55-year-old man was shot dead while taking his teenager son to school on his motorcycle, the Pratapgarh police on Saturday detained the 17-year-old boy for allegedly plotting his father’s murder. The boy was unhappy with his father’s “frequent objections to his wrong activities” and being denied pocket money, police said. “Apart from detaining the victim’s son, we arrested three more persons – all local residents aged in their 20s – in the case. Two are friends of the victim’s son and the third is a person involved in the killing. A search is on for two more assailants,” said a police officer. The boy’s friends passed on information about the victim to “contract killers,” officer said. “The murder was executed in a planned manner. We have collected solid evidence against the accused,” said Superintendent of Police, Pratapgarh, Satpal. The victim used to run a shop in Pratapgarh and his daughter works with a private firm in another state, police said. He was shot dead by a group of three persons on Thursday, they added. Police said that the detained boy told them about his “discontent” over his father’s “restrictive behaviour” and cited frequent arguments, also claiming that his father often resorted to “physical punishment.” The boy admitted that he initially planned to kill his father with the help of his two friends, but failed, police said. Subsequently, he contacted a “contract killer” through an acquaintance. “At first, the contract killer demanded Rs 20 lakh. However, after negotiations, an agreement was reached at Rs 6 lakh,” said a police officer. Police claimed that the teenager purportedly provided Rs. 1.5 lakh in advance and promised to give the rest of the amount after the crime. The boy claimed to have acquired the initial sum mostly through contributions from his friends. The culprits tracked the victim’s movements over the past week, police said. On March 21, when the victim was taking his son to school, three persons intercepted their vehicle and shot him in the chest, resulting in instant death. An FIR was registered on a complaint filed by victim’s sibling. The teenager is likely to be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board on Sunday, and other three would be produced in a court, police said. A 'serial entrepreneur' pitched his online seller platform for 'kirana stores' on Shark Tank India, aiming to bring over 2 crore local stores in India on his platform Kiko Live and eventually onboard them on ONDC.

"Other significant contests in 1st phase: Nagina, Saharanpur & Muzaffarnagar","ONE OF the significant seats in Uttar Pradesh is Nagina, which is also the only reserved seat in the state set to vote in the first phase. Nagina has a dominant population of scheduled castes as well as Muslims. In 2019, the seat was won by BSP candidate Girish Chandra who defeated Yashwant Singh of the BJP by a margin of nearly 67,000 votes, but the entry of Bhim Army chief and Azad Samaj Party leader Chandrashekhar Aazad has changed the equations on this seat now as he is banking on his popularity among Dalit voters, especially youngsters. The Muslim voters on this seat are said to be over 50 per cent and the Ansari community, which is considered backward, comprises a significant chunk. The BJP has named sitting MLA from Nihtaur Assembly seat, Om Kumar, here, who is hoping to capitalise on being a local. The Samajwadi Party has picked retired additional district judge Manoj Kumar for this seat. The BSP decided to replace its sitting MP Girish Chand on this seat with Surendra Pal Singh. Singh contested 2022 Assembly polls as BSP candidate from Purkazi Assembly seat in Muzaffarnagar but lost to the RLD’s Anil Kumar. Another seat that will in vote the first phase is Saharanpur, from where Imran Masood of Congress has filed his nomination papers, alongside sitting BJP MP Raghav Lakhan Pal. While there is no SP candidate on this seat, as it is the only seat in the first phase, which has been given to the Congress as part of the INDIA alliance, Mazid Ali is in the fray for the BSP. In Saharanpur, the BSP’s Haji Fazrul Rehman defeated Raghav Lakhan Pal of the BJP by around 20,000 votes in 2019. Imran Masood of the Congress, who contested in 2019, secured around 1 lakh votes. In Muzaffarnagar, which is also going for polls in this phase, BJP has repeated its sitting MP Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, while Samajwadi Party is banking on four time MLA and former Rajya Sabha MP harendra Mallik. BSP has fielded Dara Singh on this seat, who is a “Prajapati” by caste. A 'serial entrepreneur' pitched his online seller platform for 'kirana stores' on Shark Tank India, aiming to bring over 2 crore local stores in India on his platform Kiko Live and eventually onboard them on ONDC.

"Lucknow CBI court convicts 7 persons in BSP MLA Raju Pal murder case in 
which Atiq Ahmad was also accused","Lucknow: A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Friday convicted seven persons in the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Raju Pal murder case in 2005, in which gangster-turned-politician Atiq Ahmad, who was shot dead by three persons posing as journalists at point-blank range in police custody in Prayagraj on April 15 last year, was also an accused. The Special CBI court in Lucknow, held Ranjeet Pal, Abid, Farhan Ahmad, Israr Ahmad, Javed, Gulhasan, and Abdul Kavi guilty in the Raju Pal murder case for criminal conspiracy and murder among other serious charges. Accused Farhan Ahmad was additionally held guilty under the Arms Act. Officials told news agency PTI that the proceedings against Atiq Ahmad, prime accused Khalid Azim alias Ashraf, brother of Atiq Ahmad, and Gulbul alias Rafiq were abated after their death. Raju Pal was murdered on January 25, 2005 as a result of political rivalry with Ashraf, whom Raju Pal had defeated in the 2004 bypoll to the Prayagraj West seat. Atiq Ahmad had won this seat defeating BSP candidate Raju Pal and he vacated the seat after being elected to Lok Sabha. Raju Pal, however, later defeated Ashraf in the bypoll. The CBI took over the Raju Pal murder case in 2016. Atiq Ahmad and his brother Ashraf Ahmad were killed by three persons, who posed as journalists, in Prayagraj on April 15 last year while they were in police custody in the Umesh Pal murder case. The Ahmad brothers were being taken to a hospital for their medical check-up when three persons shot them dead at point-blank range. Atiq Ahmad’s son Asad Ahmad, who was wanted by the Uttar Pradesh Police in connection with the Umesh Pal murder case and was on run, was killed in a police encounter. Umesh Pal was the key witness in the Raju Pal murder case and was shot dead in February last year near his home in Prayagraj along with his two security personnel.",0

No Gandhi in Pilibhit fray this time,"With the deadline for filing nominations having ended on Wednesday, it is now clear that BJP’s Varun Gandhi will not contest as an Independent on Pilibhit seat, which has been won by his mother Maneka Gandhi or him continuously since 1996. But this time, the BJP has fielded sitting MLA and UP Cabinet minister Jitin Prasad on this seat. In Pilibhit, which will also go to the polls in this phase, the equations have changed as no member of the Gandhi family is contesting this time either as an Independent nor a candidate of any party. The BSP has fielded a Muslim candidate, Anis Ahmad Khan, on this seat, while the Samajwadi Party is banking on veteran leader Bhagwat Saran Gangwar. A 'serial entrepreneur' pitched his online seller platform for 'kirana stores' on Shark Tank India, aiming to bring over 2 crore local stores in India on his platform Kiko Live and eventually onboard them on ONDC. However, Deepinder Goyal, Vineeta Singh, and Aman Gupta expressed concerns about the company's scalability and viability in a highly competitive market.",1
"72% stray dogs sterilised, but still another decade for efforts to pay off","Subscribe Now! Get features like Even with the ongoing stray dog sterilisation programme, which has been in effect since September 2019, experts indicate that it can take another decade before any noticeable impact is seen on the streets of the state capital. Meanwhile, official data suggests that 71.9% or around 73,000 stray dogs had been sterilised by December last year in Lucknow. “We have to first aim at reducing the population (of stray dogs), or for it to remain within a very specific range, before hoping to stabilise it,” said Keren Nazareth, senior director at Humane Society of International (HSI), an international animal rights organisation that has partnered with the Lucknow Municipal Corporation for the sterilisation programme. “One of the tangible indicators of the initiative’s impact is fewer lactating or pregnant dogs, and fewer litters. Beyond that, it’s a waiting game as we continue to sterilise dogs over the age of six months. The impact may be seen in another 7-8 years at the least,” said Dr. Sanjay Ahir, a veterinarian at HSI’s Lucknow unit. Ahir noted that earlier 100 such surgeries were conducted at the facility every day on average. However, a recent guideline by Animal Welfare Board of India has brought down the number since it asks that dogs be kept at facilities for at least five days for better recovery before they are discharged. “So, we are not able to perform more than 60 surgeries a day,” he added. The HSI team performed sterilisation of 2,816 dogs in 2019, 10,641 in 2020, 15,598 in 2021, 19,682 in 2022 and 22,774 last year, indicating that the number of surgeries has gone up by over eight times since the drive was launched. Surveys carried out by the NGO, meanwhile, reflected that the dog population density has grown by a meagre 1% in the last three years. Amit Chaudhary, the head of surveys carried out by HSI, explained that roads spanning around 265 km across all eight zones of the city were surveyed twice a year. In 2019, the survey reflected that Lucknow was home to 75,678 dogs (estimated), and a 1% rise in density would mean that in three years, the dog population rose by a meagre 800 (approximate). “Legally, stray dogs cannot be harmed or relocated. It always takes time for the impact of a sterilisation drive to start showing... If the goal is to stabilise dog population, then the first step is to aim at reducing their population significantly,” Nazareth added.

Lucknow: Elderly woman undergoes hip revision surgery at KGMU,"Live Lucknow : Doctors at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) have successfully conducted a hip revision surgery on an 85-year-old woman. The patient had undergone surgery in her left hip 35 years ago during which the plate inserted was fixed with simple screws. The old plate, which had bone growth over it, needed to be removed for replacement. Professor Narendra Singh Kushwaha, a senior faculty at the department of orthopaedic surgery at KGMU, who led the team of doctors, said, “These days hexagonal screwdrivers are used to fix or take out a plate inserted in the bone during hip replacement. Earlier it was done with the help of simple screwdrivers as the screws used were also simple. We have only read in books about simple screws used for hip replacement.” “We had to get simple screwdrivers from the market to remove the wainwright osteotomy plate provided to her broken hip joint 35 years ago during her first hip replacement surgery. Also removing the bone formation from over the plate also took time. These complications made her run from one hospital to another as doctors refused to operate on her in view of the complications,” said Prof Kushwaha. The woman was operated on five days ago and was now able to walk on her own, the doctor said, adding that she would be discharged from the hospital soon. © 2024 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

Lucknow’s KGMU to revive kidney transplant programme after halt of one year,"King George’s Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow has decided to give a push to its kidney transplant programme that has remained suspended for nearly a year. Launched in 2014, KGMU’s kidney transplant programme faced challenges as a few faculty members left the institute, reported IANS. However, it began again in December 2022 and by April 2023, five kidney transplants were conducted. But once again, due to improper allotment of transplant operating theatre, the programme hit a roadblock. KGMU Vice-Chancellor Prof Soniya Nityanand said arrangements are being made to make the operating theatre available to the transplant unit on a regular basis, IANS further added. “Two operating schedules have been set aside for kidney transplants. This will help take the kidney transplant programme ahead smoothly,” the vice-chancellor said. The university in Uttar Pradesh also started a Cadaveric Multi-Organ Donation (CMOD) programme, eight years ago, with an aim to save hundreds of lives per year by retrieving organs from brain-dead patients for transplant into those patients whose organs have failed. CMOD was started in KGMU by the Department of Surgical Gastroenterology in 2016. At present, the majority of kidney and liver transplants in UP are taking place through live donations. © edexlive 2024",1

Lucknow police book residents for stone pelting during demolition drive,"The Lucknow police on Monday filed an FIR against protesting residents who allegedly pelted stones at employees of the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) and the police during a demolition drive in the Akbar Nagar area the previous day. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Lucknow) Raveen Tyagi said the FIR was filed at the Mahanagar police station in response to a complaint from a LDA official. It named seven people, while several others were unidentified. No one has been arrested in the case so far. The accused have been booked on various charges under the Indian Penal Code, including rioting, voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty and endangering the life or personal safety of others. The police also booked them under charges of Damage to Public Property Act. On Sunday, an LDA team and the police reached the Akbar Nagar area to demolish three commercial complexes. The situation escalated when rumours spread that some people were killed after being trapped under the debris during the demolition of one of the buildings. There was also a rumour that the LDA would demolish residential houses, prompting the people to protest. Many residents gathered there and pelted stones at the LDA team and police. The matter was resolved when additional police teams arrived and pacified the protesters. However, no injuries were reported in the stand-off. Two government vehicles were damaged in the stone-pelting while “mild force” was used to bring the situation under control, the police said. On March 6, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court stayed the demolition drive in Akbar Nagar and directed the state government to ensure that all the people being rehabilitated from there (slums) and applying for EWS houses are provided accommodations and that the entire process of shifting is completed by March 31. The eviction drive is part of the administration’s plans to beautify and develop Akbar Nagar, located on the banks of the Kukrail nullah. The Authority passed the demolition order citing illegal constructions on the Kukrail’s riverbed and banks. A 'serial entrepreneur' pitched his online seller platform for 'kirana stores' on Shark Tank India, aiming to bring over 2 crore local stores in India on his platform Kiko Live and eventually onboard them on ONDC.

Lucknow: BJP may drop half a dozen more sitting MPs in UP,"Live Lucknow : The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in Uttar Pradesh is expected to drop half a dozen more sitting MPs, known for their ‘under-performance’. The party is yet to announce candidates on 12 seats in the state. According to sources, the BJP has gathered inputs on its MPs’ performances with the help of grassroots functionaries, including those from RSS. Earlier, it had dropped 9 of the 11 sitting MPs in its second list of candidates in the state. The performance of MPs is expected to play a role in deciding their candidature, party sources said. About half a dozen MPs out of 12 are under scrutiny of the BJP brass over their alleged “unsatisfactory” performance. Of the 12 remaining seats, BJP had won 9 seats – Kaushambhi, Prayagraj, Kaiserganj, Machhlishahr, Deoria, Phulpur, Bhadohi, Firozabad, and Ballia – in 2019. Mainpuri, Rae Bareli, and Ghosi were won by SP, Congress and BSP, respectively. The main focus is on Kaiserganj which is represented by former Wrestling Federation president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been embroiled in allegations of sexual harassment by women wrestlers. The BJP could nominate his wife, Ketki Singh, or their son Prateek Bhushan Singh, who is an MLA from Gonda. However, party sources said Brij Bhushan has been in touch with the BJP brass and is confident of getting the ticket for himself. Prayagraj MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who will turn 75 on July 22 this year, is also likely to be dropped. She had earlier announced that she would not contest the 2024 elections. The BJP has already sidelined its eight-time MP from Bareilly, Santosh Gangwar, on account of his advanced age. BJP MP from Ballia, Virendra Singh, is under the scanner ever since he announced the construction of an auditorium in the name of SP patriarch and party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav in 2022. “The MPs who have been denied a ticket or are expected to be denied in the future would be engaged in organisational work,” said a UP BJP spokesperson. The BJP is contesting 75 out of 80 seats in UP, leaving the remaining five for its allies -two each for RLD and Apna Dal (S) and one for SBSP. © 2024 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

"After 7 years, Lucknow finally gets Outer Ring Road","Subscribe Now! Get features like LUCKNOW The state capital on Monday finally got its eight-lane 104-km Outer Ring Road after a wait of seven years as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a grand ceremony in Gurugram (Haryana), virtually inaugurated three packages of the road, constructed at a cost of ₹5,500 crore, in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh and chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow. The Outer Ring Road will take some time to get fully operational. Work is underway on war footing on the Sitapur road patch, where the NHAI has stopped movement of heavy vehicles. The road will streamline travel for commuters heading to Barabanki, Gorakhpur, Ayodhya, Sitapur, Gonda, Hardoi, Kanpur, Varanasi, Rae Bareli, Sultanpur, and other districts, eliminating the necessity of passing through Lucknow to reach these destinations, said defence minister Rajnath Singh speaking at a programme organised at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan. “Commuters will reach their destinations directly, bypassing Lucknow. Besides, it will ease traffic congestion in Lucknow,” he added. Once operational, the Outer Ring Road is expected to divert an estimated one lakh vehicles daily, offering relief to commuters from traffic congestion within the city. This project is poised to accelerate the economic progress of Lucknow with numerous schemes planned along its route. “In his address, defence minister Rajnath Singh said heavy vehicles would not be allowed to move on certain stretches of the Outer Ring Road for the next 15 days. But we are confident that work will be completed on that stretch in the next few days while the load testing of the stretch will also be done before starting heavy traffic,” said an elated Saurabh Chaurasia, project manager of NHAI. He added, “In addition, the Green Corridor being built by the Lucknow Development Authority, which will connect Shaheed Path via the cut near Gomti River, is set to ease traffic congestion even further.” The road also holds strategic importance as it intersects five national and six state highways. Sultanpur Road, Rae Bareli Road, Hardoi Road, Kanpur Road, Ayodhya Road and Sitapur Road are some of the key routes that the ring road connects to. This connectivity facilitates efficient transportation within Lucknow and positions the city as a key hub for economic activities and regional integration. SALIENT FEATURES 157 entry and exit points 43 villages covered The stretch has 26 bridges, 6 RoBs, 12 flyovers, 34 underpasses 1,500 acres acquired for the project in Barabanki and Lucknow IN 2016 construction of Outer Ring Road commenced. It was expected to become operational in 2021, but due to Covid and other factors, the project got delayed. Anupam Srivastava is a Special Correspondent with Hindustan Times, Lucknow.

How not to get sick while traveling in India,"Breathedreamgo The transformational travel guide Table of Contents TRAVEL IN INDIA, and in so many other places, definitely has its challenges. But that’s no reason not to go. In fact, it often seems the greater the challenge, the greater the reward! One of the biggest fears a lot of people have about traveling in a so-called ‘developing’ nation or region like India (or Thailand, Africa, and Southeast Asia) is getting sick. There are many things you can do to avoid getting sick while traveling in India. Over many years of experience, I’ve learned how to help prevent travel sickness, how to help prevent and cure travelers diarrhea aka Delhi Belly, what foods to eat and what foods to avoid, what medicines to take, and generally how to stay healthy in India and while traveling in Asia — and I’ve rounded up all my best tips in this post including My top 10 tips on how to avoid getting sick in India (see below). My own experience is that there’s usually nothing to fear but fear itself. A positive attitude, a healthy immune system, and liberal doses of resilience, resourcefulness, caution, and common sense are usually enough to get most travelers through most situations. But here are some tips that I’ve discovered for preventing and coping with the most common issues travelers face in India such as travelers diarrhea. The main health related issues you could face in India are: Most of this post is about preventing and managing travelers diarrhea and Delhi Belly, which is by far the most common illness travelers face in India. However, I also want to underline the importance of preventing dengue and other vector borne diseases such as malaria by wearing long sleeves and pants, and using a mosquito repellent that contains DEET. Most hotel rooms also have plug-in devices to prevent mosquitoes, so I highly recommend using them. There are no vaccines for dengue, which is common in India, so preventing mosquito bites is the best strategy. Rabies is a very serious disease that can result in death if not treated, so if you are bitten or scratched by an animal in India, you must seek treatment immediately, within 24 hours. You will need to get a course of shots over several days. There is a rabies vaccine, but you still need to get treated with shots if you are bitten or scratched, so most people don’t bother with the vaccine. Other potential diseases such as typhoid, hepatitis, and tetanus can be prevented by vaccine. I recommend visiting a travel medical clinic to find out what you need for India at the time you are going. If you are getting travel vaccinations for the first time, you really have to start early. Visit a travel medical clinic to find out what’s recommended. Start getting your vaccines three months before you depart. The first time I went to India, I needed several vaccinations, including Twinrix (for hepatitis A and B). Thank goodness I started getting",1

It's divided into two parts—the crumbling buildings of Old Delhi, and the orderly, well-planned streets of New Delhi—which exist side by side, but feel like they're worlds apart. Delhi's estimated population is more than 16 million, and it is rapidly growing. It recently overtook Mumbai as the largest city in India. Delhi hasn't always been the capital of India, nor has it always been called Delhi. The city's long history has seen many empires and rulers come and go, including the Mughals who ruled northern India for over three centuries. New Delhi began construction in 1911 during the British colonial period and replaced Kolkata as the capital of India. This Delhi guide will help you plan your trip to this historic city, including when to go and what to do. Delhi's top attractions are its mosques, forts, and monuments left over from the Mughal rulers that once occupied the city. Many of these are set in beautifully landscaped gardens that are perfect for relaxing. The contrast between rambling Old Delhi and well-planned New Delhi is immense, and it's interesting to spend time visiting both. Delhi also has some of the best markets in India, making the city a sought-after shopping destination. To explore Delhi on foot, try a walking tour. Once you've seen enough monuments, check out some unusual things to do in Delhi. Sightseeing in Delhi can be split between the following three main areas: Explore more Delhi highlights with our guides to the best things to do in Delhi, the best markets, and fun things to do with kids. Delhi is renowned for both its street food and fine dining restaurants. Rich, meat-dominated Mughlai and Punjabi cuisines are most prevalent. They were established in the city when Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan set up his capital in the 17th century, and when people migrated from the Punjab region following The Partition of India in 1947. The popularity of modern Indian cuisine has grown in Delhi in recent years, with new restaurants using innovative cooking techniques and global ingredients. Fancy cocktail bars are also popping up across the city in trendy locations such as Connaught Place, Khan Market, and the new Aerocity hospitality precinct adjacent to Delhi airport.

"Should I go on a slum tour? Meeting the local guides in Delhi's Sanjay 
Colony","Reality Tours and Travel's model of no-photo tours, employing local guides from under-privileged areas and returning 80% of the post-tax profits back to the community proved extremely beneficial to locals. The entrance to Sanjay Colony slum glitters like a catwalk. Sequins are strewn all over the street and to either side rise great mounds of discarded clothes. ""Welcome to mini Delhi,"" beams my 21-year-old guide, Shehnaz Khan, her smart blue shirt sticking to her in the midday heat. Sanjay Colony covers 25 acres, is home to around 50,000 people, and sits in the heart of southern Delhi's industrial area, where the recycling of plastic, packaging, and clothes is hand sorted (mainly by women) 14 hours a day for a wage of 200 rupees (roughly £2). ""My father used to work in Sanjay as a tailor when he first came to Delhi 20 years ago. We've come full circle as now I lead tours here,"" says Shehnaz, proudly. Reality Tours and Travel started running tours in Mumbai's Dharavi slum — Asia's largest — in 2006. Its model of no-photo tours, employing local guides from under-privileged areas, and returning 80% of the post-tax profits back to the community via its sister NGO, Reality Gives, proved so beneficial to locals it transplanted the scheme to Delhi four years ago. ""We talked to the community and asked them what they wanted. They said they needed to learn English (the government only provides education in Hindi) and computer studies, so we offer just that,"" says Shehnaz. We weave down narrow alleys — wide enough for just one motorbike — dodging deep drains filled with grey sludge and crisp packets, and past street sellers with their bicycle baskets bulging with mangoes, bananas and lychees. The street itself is spotless; swept clean and lined with fortresses of blue jerry cans (for water). Occasionally, I swat away a fly lured by the wafts of frying onions and washing powder. Shehnaz points out the strings of chillies and lemons hanging above doorways ""to stop black magic"", and hole-in-the-wall shops ""like my father used to work in"", where men sitting at whirring Singer sewing machines stop momentarily to wave. Kids seated on stoops with schoolbooks across their laps spring to their feet on seeing me. ""Hello! How are youuuu?"" they chime, placing their small hands in mine as we walk a block or two. We arrive at the home of Khazani Devi. A sleeping dog guards the steep narrow stairs to the first floor, where we find Khazani cooking chapattis over a two-ring gas cooker. She's the mother of Vijay Kumar, a Reality Tours guide who was born and grew up in Sanjay. He lives in the four-room block with his four brothers, their wives, children and his parents. Khazani puts on lunch for guests to earn extra income. Dressed in a green kurti, with a bulge on her bosom where she's stuffed her purse, she urges me to sit on the bed. Her face dimples when she points to",2

Foreign Tourists Skipping Delhi over Air Quality Fears | Weather.com,"As Delhi’s air quality continues to worsen, it is now affecting the foreign tourist footfall in the city. The increase in pollution levels and the smog has led to rescheduling, rerouting and cancellation of foreign tourists’ India visit, as they are dropping the capital from their travel itinerary. An increasing number of tourists is opting for hill stations instead of Dilli darshan. Travel agencies and tour operators say that Delhi’s foreign tourist inflow has gone down by 25-30% due to pollution. Delhi’s toxic air has also become a permanent feature in the travel advisories issued by countries like the US, the UK and Mexico to their citizens. Golden Triangle most affected An ASSOCHAM report of 2017, which was based on discussions with 350 tour operators, predicted that “Delhi is bound to drop off from the map of international tourists. The report states that even domestic tourists are avoiding Delhi, and there is a deep concern over the negative impact the pollution can cause to the economy.” Tour operators say that FTA (Foreign Tourist Arrival) is highest in November-December, and mid-October to March is the peak period. But this year, the tourist inflow is down by 25-30% during this period. The Golden Triangle tourist circuit – Delhi, Agra and Jaipur – that most tourists opt for, has been affected the most because of Delhi’s bad air quality. Sharat Dhall, COO (B2C), Yatra.com, says, “The deteriorating air quality in India, especially in Delhi, has affected the influx of travelers from all around the world, impacting both hotel and flight bookings. Many travelers have complained about the deteriorating air quality, which has led them to cut their trips short. Business travelers have also rescheduled their trips.” A spokesperson for ClearTrip said, “Delhi is an important destination for both business and leisure travelers. The leisure travellers may start looking at other travel hubs if adequate measures to curb the increasing pollution are not implemented soon.” Travel agents to raise concerns to government Recently, the Travel Agents Association Of India (TAAI) held a meeting to take stock of the situation. Travel agents say that hotels, travel agencies and tour operators have been hit the worst due to air pollution. Rajan Sehgal, Chairman, Public Relations, TAAI, says, “Delhi is one of the world’s favourite travel destinations. On an average, a foreign tourist spends three-four nights in Delhi, but at present, they are either not coming to Delhi or spending just one night here. There are also very few new reservations. We have observed a dip of at least 25-30% this season.” He adds, “We can only hope that the situation will change soon. Because of the loss that the travel industry is suffering, we will be discussing the situation with the Ministry of Tourism so that they can take it up with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.” Tourists opting for hill stations Travel agents say that things are not just bad this year; Delhi’s tourist footfall has been going down since 2016 and",2
Poverty tours: A learning experience or simply gawking?,"Editor’s Note: Moni Basu, a reporter for CNN.com, was born in Kolkata, India and returns there every year. The charitable Salaam Baalak Trust runs a city tour in New Delhi Tourists walk through the streets of Paharganj, a poor neighborhood Former street kids act as guides through a maze of congested lanes Poverty tours have sparked controversy On a recent trip home to India, I heard a German man on my flight remark to another passenger that he’d taken his son on a tour of a Kolkata slum. I believe the man was well-intentioned – he wanted his child, accustomed to a comfortable existence, to get a firsthand look at how millions of poor people live. Later, I discovered that slum tours in India are often organized and can cost money. Reality Tours and Travel takes tourists on slum and sightseeing tours in Mumbai. A walking tour of Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum, costs only $9. For about $135, five people get a nine-hour car tour of Dharavi, the red light district of Kamathipura, as well as other more traditional tourist areas. Reality Tours founders say the tours were set up “primarily to show the positive side of the slums and break down negative stereotypes about its people and residents” who occupy cramped huts in unending stretches of squalor. They say 80% of their profits go back to local communities through social service programs. That seems like a noble cause, but then I got to thinking about the idea of poverty tours in general – how it might feel to be a slum-dweller coming face to face with a wealthy visitor gawking at me as though I were an animal in a zoo. Therein lies the debate over such tours. Kennedy Odede, the executive director of Shining Hope for Communities, a social services organization in Kenya, decried poverty tours of Nairobi’s largest slum, Kibera. He wrote in The New York Times that the tours do nothing to alleviate the problem. “Slum tourism turns poverty into entertainment, something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from,” he said. “People think they’ve really ‘seen’ something – and then go back to their lives and leave me, my family and my community right where we were before.” I decided to see for myself. When I was in New Delhi over the winter, I signed up for a walking tour in Paharganj, a neighborhood near the train station that I had always known as seedy. I’d rushed through it once before in my life, when I had to spend a night after a train was delayed. It’s not unlike the many neighborhoods in Kolkata I know so well. The smell of turmeric and green chiles mixing with that of garbage and urine. It’s a hodgepodge of activity. Women cooking. Men working. Children sleeping out in the open, a swarm of flies covering their unwashed faces. A maze of snaking alleyways and dark, dank corners. And people everywhere, entire families crowded into small rooms, sleeping",2

You're likely to land there when flying into the country. The best time to visit Delhi is during the cooler, dry months from October to March. However, it's essential to be aware that severe air pollution is a concerning factor at this time. You may also wish to plan your trip to Delhi in accordance with one of the many festivals and events that take place in the city throughout the year. Delhi has five distinct seasons, with extreme fluctuations between summer and winter temperatures. Hazardous smog blankets the city from October to March. Nowadays, it even extends into summer, with ""very unhealthy"" air quality index scores occurring in April and May. The problem is caused by a change in atmospheric conditions (a drop in temperature and wind), which traps pollutants in the lower layers of the atmosphere. It's recommended that you wear a suitable anti-pollution mask (not a surgical mask) on the days that air quality is deemed unsafe, or if you have respiratory issues such as asthma or bronchitis. Read more about the weather and climate in Delhi. Delhi is one of the most populated cities on earth, so it's crowded at any time of year. However, when sightseeing in Delhi, it's wise to avoid top monuments and attractions on weekends, particularly Sundays. Crowds swell and can be a nuisance, as locals spend time out and about with their families. Crowds also peak during Indian holidays around Dussehra in October, Diwali in November, and Holi in March. Visit monuments early in the morning for the most peaceful experience. Central shopping areas including Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazaar, Connaught Place, Janpath, Sunder Nagar, and Khan Market, are closed on Sundays (larger shops in Khan Market have started staying open though). Other markets such as Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar are closed on Mondays. Many tourist attractions, including museums and monuments, are also closed on Mondays. Hauz Khas market is closed on Tuesdays. If you're looking to save money, you'll find plenty of enticingly cheap deals available for travel during the low season from April to June. This includes discounted e-tourist visas. However, the trade-off is sweltering weather. These top things to do indoors in Delhi will provide some respite from the heat.

study tour","A study tour to the Northeast for members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture was cancelled at the last minute due to a difference of opinion between the committee and the Rajya Sabha Secretariat over who will be the official accompanying them. The panel, headed by YSRCP leader V Vijayasai Reddy, was expected to visit Guwahati, Gangtok and Tawang from April 15 to 19. All arrangements had been made for the 19-members committee but a dispute then arose. While the committee insisted that a senior official — at the level of Joint Secretary or Director — should be present to ensure the tour goes off smoothly, the Secretariat maintained that an Additional Director-level officer would accompany them because under a new norm every official should get a chance to travel with committees. The tour was cancelled subsequently. While some MPs had reached Delhi before the scheduled date of travel, one senior BJP MP had even reached Gangtok, and had to return. All members of the panel are learnt to backed their chairman’s stand that a senior official should accompany them. No Stone Unturned That the Congress and the Gandhi siblings are putting all their might to upstage the BJP in Karnataka is now clear. But in a surprise move, even UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who has not campaigned in elections for a long time, will also join the electioneering by addressing a public meeting in Hubballi on May 6. Sonia had addressed only one rally — that, too, in virtual mode — even in Uttar Pradesh elections last year. She had addressed one public meeting in Karnataka in the 2018 elections as well — and even then, her rally had come after a two-year break. Recalling A Friend It may be two days late, but the Japanese embassy has made sure it records its appreciation of the 100th episode of PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme. On Wednesday, the embassy recalled a message by late Japanese PM Shinzo Abe in the preface to the book ‘Mann Ki Baat: A Social Revolution on Radio’, remembering the 89th episode, where Modi lauded India-Japan cultural ties while citing Japanese artists who stage the Mahabharat and the Ramayan in Asian countries. Replying to the tweet thread, the Prime Minister posted: “Thank you for the kind words and for also remembering my friend, late Shinzo Abe.” The Supreme Court deemed electoral bonds as unconstitutional, causing the Finance Ministry to stop printing 10,000 bonds worth Rs 1 crore each. It was discovered that 8,350 bonds had already been printed and 22,217 were redeemed, with the BJP redeeming the most. The remaining 1,650 were instructed to be halted by the State Bank of India.",1
My top safety tips for women travelling in India,"Breathedreamgo The transformational travel guide Table of Contents IS TRAVEL IN INDIA safe for women? Is the concern over travel safety for women tourists justified? What are the most important travel safety tips for female travellers who visit India? These are some of the top questions and top concerns women have when planning a trip to India. Travel in India is different than many other destinations. It’s not for everyone. You need to be ready, you need to feel confident, and you need to exercise caution and common sense. But if you do feel called to India, I wouldn’t hesitate. I would, however, prepare, do research and practise “safe travel strategies.” That’s why I put together these 20 safety tips for women travelling in India. I have travelled across India for more than five eight years in total, over the past 17 years — most of it solo. I now live in Rishikesh, in North India. In all that time, I have rarely felt unsafe, and I personally do not feel India is particularly dangerous for female travellers. I do think, however, that India is uncomfortable for women. I have often felt uncomfortable by unwanted attention, especially staring, and I’ve been followed in the street a few times. The worst thing that’s happened was that I was groped in Old Delhi, while riding a bicycle rickshaw. I had my telephone stolen from my purse by a group of women, who surrounded me at a temple in Mumbai. An Uber driver drove me around behind the airport for 30 minutes, to increase the fare – that was nerve-wracking. But I have never felt seriously threatened or really unsafe. When I am asked the question, Is India safe? I answer: that’s not the right question. Anything can happen anywhere. It’s not about WHERE you travel, but HOW you travel. I’m a big believer in caution … but fear, not so much. The media has incited fear among many women travellers, and I don’t think feeling fearful is a good way to approach travel or life. Although I do not hesitate to pursue my travel dreams in India, I am always careful about my planning – to make sure I don’t arrive on a train platform alone in the middle of the night for example. And I am cautious about my dress and deportment. So please read on to have all your questions answered about travel safety in India. And follow my top tips for women travelling in India – and travel with confidence. Going to India? Read my Ultimate Guide to Travel in India for a comprehensive overview of everything you need to know – includes a guide to the resources on this site for travellers to India. Keep the Tourist Helpline number handy and call if you need any assistance while in India: 1 800 111363. When I was my planning my first trip to India back in 2005, I don’t recall any particular warnings about travel safety for women. Nothing",1

"Read my top tips for things to do in Delhi, and do Delhi right!","Breathedreamgo The transformational travel guide Table of Contents UPDATED APRIL 2019: New Delhi, India is a huge, sprawling metropolis. An ancient city with a storied past, Delhi is one of the most historical cities on earth. It also has a very vibrant present as the capital of the world’s largest democracy. There are so many things to do in Delhi it’s hard to even know how to begin a Delhi city guide, and what Delhi travel tips to offer, to visitors and tourists who want to explore and experience the best sights, hotels, attractions, landmarks and fun, cool things to do. Note: New Delhi is also called just Delhi, or in Hindi, Dilli. So here goes, my tips for the best things to do in Delhi – based on many years of living in Delhi on-and-off. There are truly a lot of things to do in Delhi, from a street food tour of Old Delhi, to watching the sunrise at India Gate, to exploring the city’s three UNESCO World Heritage sites (Red Fort, Qutb Minar, Humayun’s Tomb) – these are things you must do in Delhi. And don’t forget shopping in Delhi, one of my favourite pastimes. Or you can visit the famous temples of Delhi. But first … Most visitors to India land either in Delhi or Mumbai (Bombay). And it is from these cities that they glean their first impressions. Unfortunately, Delhi does not always make a good first impression. I was lucky, from my very first day in India, I stayed with an Indian family in South Delhi. True Dilli-wallahs, they helped me see the beauty and essential charm of the city and provided the keys to discover hidden treasures that most tourists miss. I grew to love the city and I hope you will give it a chance, too. Personally, I think Delhi is a glorious city. As well as being my home-away-from-home, I also find it inspiring and endlessly fascinating. Like Rome, Delhi is an eternal city. Not only is it the capital of modern India, it has been the capital of at least seven previous civilizations, and each have left behind a trail of monuments. It’s also a very green city, criss-crossed by wide, leafy boulevards; and it’s the country’s cultural heart and political centre. Plus, Delhi is known as a gastronome’s pleasure garden and a shopper’s paradise. In other words, there’s lots of things to do in Delhi, and many reasons to love the city.

Golden Triangle Tour of India,"Breathedreamgo The transformational travel guide Table of Contents The Golden Triangle is the most well-known tourist route in India for foreign visitors. This “triangle” of destinations includes the historic city of Delhi, which boasts three UNESCO World Heritage sites; Agra, home of the Taj Mahal, the world’s most beautiful building; and Jaipur, the Pink City, capital of Rajasthan. A Golden Triangle tour of India takes in all three cities, which are roughly equidistant and you can drive between them in just 4-5 hours or so. This is called the Golden Triangle of India tour with Delhi, Agra, Jaipur. My company, India for Beginners custom tours, does a Golden Triangle tour of India, but we include a lot of unique, authentic, and offbeat experiences; special hand-picked hotels; amazing guides; plus we offer a lot of insider tips. We can also do a luxury golden triangle tour with stays in five-star hotels such as The Imperial Delhi, The Claridges Delhi, ITC Mughal, Oberoi Amarvilas, Rambagh Palace, Sujan Rajmahal Palace and more. And we can organize a four-day Golden Triangle Tour and various Golden Triangle Tour packages. Recently, the India for Beginners team went on a Golden Triangle tour together to discover the very best of Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. We are constantly on the lookout for the latest information, the hippest restaurants, the most stylish hotels, and unique new experiences to share with our guests. Here are our picks for The best luxury getaways near Delhi. Golden Triangle tours usually start in Delhi, as most international visitors land at Indira Gandhi International Airport in southwest Delhi. The capital of India, Delhi is a sprawling megalopolis of more than 20 million people (the actual number depends on whether the National Capital Region is included), and one of the most historic cities on earth. Over the past 2,000 or so years, at least seven or eight major civilizations have built their capitals at Delhi – and each has left behind an impressive trail of forts, tombs, and other monuments. We start our Golden Triangle tour by picking you up at the airport and delivering you to a Central or South Delhi hotel or guest house. We believe strongly in picking up new visitors to India at the airport as the experience can be overwhelming. Central Delhi is the most beautiful part of the city – it was designed by the British with wide, leafy boulevards and elegant white bungalows. In South Delhi, you can enjoy the quieter side of life in the capital and live more like a local, visiting cafes, parks, and local markets without the hassles that can spoil the more touristy areas. Please read these posts about Delhi to get a feel for the city: For those who like luxury, our favourite hotel is The Claridges in Central Delhi. A supremely elegant hotel, The Claridges is a historic landmark that was built in 1955 in the heart of Lutyens Delhi. It was designed in a classic style to mirror the Art",0

Through the app, travellers can also book tickets and plan their tour around Delhi. ""The tourists who want to visit Delhi can now plan their tour by using the ‘Dekho Mere Dilli’ mobile app. They can plan their entire tour on one platform. They can even buy tickets for the places they want to visit in the national capital,"" said Kejriwal on Monday. The CM said that the app has all the information about eating joints, fun places, historic sites, entertainment venues in the national capital while adding that the tourist can also locate places within 5 km with the help of the app. ""With this, we have the hope that the tourism sector in Delhi will get a boost. People from all around visit here and they face difficulties in getting information about these places. So this app will help tourists,"" said Kejriwal. He further urged everyone, including the people of Delhi, to download the tourism app ""Dekho Mere Dilli"". Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the app will help the tourist to plan their complete journey. ""Dekho Meri @ArvindKejriwal launched the Delhi Tourism's mobile app today.

He further said through this app we can tell people coming to Delhi about the places in the city. ""The flavour of tourism is associated with happiness, if there is tourism, then there is happiness and if there is happiness, then there is tourism.

Those who show: Guides as key stakeholders of tourism in ‘Incredible India’,"“’Where was Bahadur Shah Zafar II exiled at the end of the Mughal era?’ This question was worth Rs one crore on Kaun Banega Crorepati… I say this as part of my tour at the Lal Qila,” Rajendra Singh, 49, shared this piece of trivia in between his seasoned monologue-like guide about the architectural marvel of New Delhi’s Red Fort. With a Master’s degree in French and proficiency in Spanish, Rajendra Singh is a veteran tour guide disseminating information and insights on the 125-acre fort complex for the last 10 years. He is among the 12 regional-level guides (now called Incredible India Tourist Guides [IITGs]) at Lal Qila with licenses approved by the Ministry of Tourism and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The Red Fort comes under the ASI which administers 3,687 ancient monuments and archaeological sites and remains of national importance across the country. “Every day is tourism day for us,” Singh said in his rhythmic speed with genuine sincerity when informed about the annual observance of World Tourism Day on September 27 by the United Nations World Tourism Organization since 1980. Having started out as a UPSC aspirant, Rajendra Singh now also teaches French language at the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) on weekends. In his career as a tour guide, he’s given tours to two Prime Ministers, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina seven years ago and to former UK PM Lizz Truss in 2022. He even guided a batch of G20 delegates this year. “There was an interview and I was selected. Usually, big events like G20 obstruct our business as guides because sightseeing is restricted to the public. Only Diwali to Holi (Oct-Nov to March) is peak season,” he said. Post Covid-19, tourism has not picked up yet, Singh said, showing pictures with celebrities – from politicians to people from the entertainment industry – he has met. “Everyone gets 40-45 minutes of the tour – authentic and up-to-date,” he added with a smile. A fellow tour guide at Lal Qila, Amit Chauhan, 44, said: “Back in the day we used to be around three to four guides here. We had to rely on our savings during the Covid-19-induced lockdowns. After that, the number of guides increased as people quit from the private tour companies which took a hit due to the pandemic. The competition keeps increasing while demand peaks seasonally for about 180 days.” Chauhan with a Master’s in History and an MBA in Travel Management is proficient in Hindi, English, and German, and has been a guide since 2014. He manages to take four to five tours on “good days”. One can find many such tour guides at Red Fort, Qutub Minar, and Humayun’s Tomb in the national capital. According to Singh and Chauhan, tour guides traditionally charge half-day or full-day tours at rates of Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,000, respectively. A full-day ‘Delhi darshan’ would include guided visits to the Lal Qila, Rajghat, Jantar Mantar, Rashtrapati Bhavan, President House, and end with the",1
Covid-19 pushes tourism in Delhi to the edge,"Subscribe Now! Get features like Satyam Bhatnagar runs a handicrafts shop in Paharganj’s main bazar, a backpackers’ paradise that boasts of hundreds of touristy establishments such as money changers, hotels, rooftop restaurants, tour operators, and handicrafts shops selling a range of stone and wood sculptures, puppets and magnets featuring Delhi monuments. His shop, Bhatnagar says, always saw a steady stream of foreign tourists before the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March. “But in the past seven months, I have not seen a single foreigner in the market which once teemed with tourists from all over the world at any hour of the day. Our sales are almost down to zero,” he says. The pandemic has almost wiped out tourism in Delhi. Paharganj, once a bustling, thriving market whose entire economy depends on foreign tourists, is a microcosm of the devastation caused by the ongoing coronavirus crisis in the capital’s tourism sector. The otherwise popular city tours conducted by Delhi Tourism ---a Delhi government undertaking that facilitates tourism in the city --- have no takers. Travel and tour operators in the city complain of the loss of lakhs of jobs and see no hope of their return in the near future. This is quite a sad turn for the tourism industry in Delhi, a city which last year was ranked 11th in the list of ‘Top 100 city destinations’ in the world by Euromonitor International, a global market research agency. Besides, it was among the country’s top four destinations with about 29 lakh foreign tourists arriving in the city in 2019, according to India Tourism statistics. This is peak travel season, and yet Paharganj wears a deserted look. No wonder then, on a bright, balmy November afternoon, Subhash Vij’s mood is dark as he sits inside his handicrafts shop filled with incense sticks, smoking pipes, designer cotton bags, and a host of brass and wood souvenirs. “Eighty per cent of our customers were foreign tourists, most of them from countries such as the US, the UK, Israel, Russia, Korea and Japan. Unlike other markets, which are thriving ever since the lockdown was lifted, shop keepers here have no business at all, as 80 per cent of the business in the market depended on foreign tourists. With restrictions on tourist visas continuing, our market is the biggest victim of the pandemic,” says Vij, who is also president of the Paharganj Market Association. Over the years as the market became a favourite with backpackers, dozens of eateries—many of them run by expats and mostly catering to foreign tourists--- came up in the market. Most, including popular ones such as Brown Bread Bakery, an Italian restaurant run by Italian and German expats, have remained shut. “Unlike restaurants in other parts of the city I cannot afford to open mine till foreign tourists are back because almost all my customers were tourists, ” says Surinder Sharma, who owns Diamond Restaurant in the market. With over 800 hotels, Paharganj is also Delhi’s biggest hotel hub—and half of",2

Slum tours: a day trip too far?,"Clearing his throat theatrically as he gets ready to reveal a highlight of the tour, group leader Javed stops halfway up the staircase to platform one and points through the railings to a dark alcove beneath the footbridge over the tracks. 'This is where the street children sleep,' he says, smiling at the cluster of tourists who are craning forward to hear his voice above the roar of the trains below. A small boy climbs out from the hole, steps across the corrugated iron roof and balances himself on a ledge on the other side of the bars, staring back at the visitors, perplexed. The tourists pause for a while taking in his malnourished appearance, his filthy clothes and glazed eyes. The boy doesn't say anything, but Javed briskly explains that this child, like a lot of the homeless children who live in New Delhi railway station, is addicted to a white correction fluid, called Eraz-Ex. Most carry a small square of cloth soaked in the chemical, which they hold to their noses and inhale periodically. 'They spend more than half the money they earn from selling rubbish they find on the platform on buying it from the stationary stalls in the market,' he says. 'It does make them a bit violent.' He pauses to give the group of visitors from Australia, Russia and England a chance to ask questions, before running through the advantages of sleeping in the gap between the platform roof and the walkway. It's shady and you have to be small to get to it, which makes it relatively safe from the station police. But there are the overhead electricity wires to look out for. 'Several of the children have been electrocuted by that wire,' he adds. For anyone weary of Mughal tombs and Lutyens architecture, a new tourist attraction is on offer for visitors to the Indian capital: a tour of the living conditions endured by the 2,000 or so street children who live in and around Delhi's main railway stations. For two hours, tour guides, themselves former street children, show visitors what life is like for the city's most deprived inhabitants. The money raised (200 rupees a ticket - £2.50) goes to a well-respected local charity which tries to rehabilitate these children. The trip is designed as an awareness-raising venture and organisers deny that this is the latest manifestation of 'poorism' - voyeuristic tourism, where rich foreigners come and gape at the lives of impoverished inhabitants of developing countries. Bus tours of the shanty towns of Soweto or guided walks through the slums of Rio have attracted curious tourists for many years; the visit to Delhi's railway underworld has been running for just a few months but has already proved popular with Western and Indian visitors. 'We've come to educate ourselves about these homeless children who live near us. Most of the time people ignore them; I think it's good to pay them some attention,' an Indian post-graduate student in the group says. The",2
"Greenpeace India Advocates Safer and Inclusive Public Transport for Women 
in Delhi with Midnight Bus Tour","On the evening of October 27, Greenpeace India conducted an all-women Midnight Bus Tour featuring women from marginalised communities, journalists, researchers, influencers, social workers and Greenpeace volunteers to put a spotlight on the hindrances to night-time travel for women, primarily due to concerns around safety and accessibility of public transport. The women came together to celebrate their agency and freedom with a strong message against any form of gender-based discrimination in public mobility spaces. Through an evening of fun, leisure, conversations and songs—which featured singer-songwriter HeyDitty, the participants travelled across Delhi to assert their Right to Mobility and demand more buses on Delhi’s streets. The tour was aimed at reclaiming public spaces for women, and it emphasised the need for Delhi’s public transport facilities to be safe and inclusive for all citizens. The participants on the bus delved into the varied challenges faced by women in accessing public mobility, especially the lack of security during night-time travel, offering a first-hand understanding of their experiences. Historically, city planning in India has overlooked the mobility rights of women and gendered minorities, focusing primarily on men and the elite. Women rely heavily on walking and public transport for various needs, including employment, education, caregiving work, and leisure. The absence of adequate first-and-last mile connectivity in public transport significantly hinders the mobility of women, especially women from lower-income communities such as domestic workers, factory workers, and informal workers, who tend to travel shorter distances for work. Concerns regarding personal safety, especially with prevalent episodes of harassment on public buses, create more hindrances for women and gender minorities. According to a recent report by the World Bank, 88 percent of surveyed women in Delhi report facing sexual harassment in public transport! Sumedha Pal, a journalist who participated in the tour, said “Public transport for women has been a site of anxiety, fear and harassment. While public buses are now free for women in Delhi, this is not enough. The Midnight Bus Tour gave us an opportunity to experience our city in an inclusive and safe manner, while also enabling us to imagine sustainable cities—which count women as equal partners in policy and planning—as an achievable reality.” Rifa Jawaid, another journalist and a participant of the tour, commented, “While I don’t usually rely on bus transportation, I would consider using buses if they were more accessible. Bike taxis and cabs might appear more convenient, but they aren’t sustainable options, and many women can’t afford them. Having more buses on our streets and ensuring the safety of all passengers would greatly simplify our commuting needs and bring more women onboard!” The tour also echoed the insights from Greenpeace India’s recent report, “Halt for Women Bus Users in Delhi” The report sheds light on the various challenges encountered by Delhi’s women bus users such as buses not stopping for women commuters and women facing harassment and discrimination for travelling without charge due to the Delhi government’s free bus ride for women scheme. The scheme, which was introduced in",0

number one","Subscribe Now! Get features like Dilli, Dilwalon ki (Delhi is for the large-hearted) isn’t just a badge of pride for Delhiites, but a promise to the tourists visiting from far and wide, that the Capital will welcome them with open arms. The state was declared the number one Indian city for tourists, among 30 Indian states, in a biennial state ranking survey, recently released by World Travel and Tourism Council, India Initiative (WTTCII), for its relative competitiveness in the area of travel and tourism. However, the veracity of such a ranking stood in conflict with the perennial problems of smog, chaotic traffic, lack of cleanliness, and not to forget pushy salespersons, plaguing the city. So, for an on-ground report, HT City visited tourist haunts in the city, to scout for and hear it from the tourists themselves about their opinion on whether Delhi indeed is the best Indian city for tourists. Here’s what they said: ‘Metro makes travelling in the city, convenient’ Paulime Mollaru, who is on her maiden trip to Delhi, couldn’t resist getting intricate henna designs applied on her hands, near Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place. “I felt for Delhi much before I landed here from France. I know that Indian women apply henna on festivals. I love Indian traditions and culture. I just love all the temples, the ethnicity and the rich history behind every place. Also, travelling through the city is so convenient because of the Metro, and I plan to visit all the places in one trip itself,” she says. ‘I get to know something new every time I visit Delhi’ Former journalist David Andrews is on his fourth trip to India, and we found him revelling in the spiritual side of Delhi, at Gurudwara Bangla Sahib . “I have travelled across India, but Delhi is special to me. It has been a passion to me, because every time I come here, I get to know about something new. Also, central Delhi is my favourite, because of its infrastructure and history. It’s shocking yet beautiful to see how people from different backgrounds, colour, and culture stay together like a family, here,” he says. ‘Old Delhi’s food tempts you to eat even if not hungry’ Eric and Lawrence, a French couple, are smitten by the charm of Old Delhi on their first ever trip. “We have been here for the last few days, and just love the place. People are really helpful, and initially we did face some difficulty, as the city was new to us, but now we feel like a part of the place. The food in Old Delhi is so tempting that even if you are not hungry, the smells will compel you to eat. We had kebabs, mutton, and many other dishes. We will visit the place again for the food, if nothing else,” says Eric, who we met in Ballimaran Market. ‘We don’t feel like leaving Delhi’ We found Hoepken and Martina, a German couple, in Old Delhi’s Jama Masjid.

WHEN SHOULD I GO? October to March is the best time, as it is the coolest. July to September is monsoon season, meaning it is hot, humid and very wet. MONEY MATTERS The currency is the Indian Rupee (INR); one rupee equals two Australian cents. You can exchange money from bureaus and banks and ATMs are everywhere. Beware private money exchangers who offer higher rates, fake notes are a problem. And prepare to negotiate, except in fixed-price shops — bargaining is normal. THE LANGUAGE There are 22 official languages in India, with Hindi used for official purposes. However, English is widely spoken, especially in tourist areas. 16 THINGS YOU MUST SEE IN INDIA TOURS OF INDIA TO SUIT EVERY BUDGET 10 PLACES YOU NEED TO SEE IN NORTHERN INDIA TIP BIG BECAUSE IT’S SMALL Everyone will expect a tip, from porters to drivers and guides. For casual meals, tip 10 per cent — for fine-dining, around 5-7 per cent, unless service has been added. Give porters around INR50 ($1) and drivers and guides 200 ($4). GETTING AROUND Indira Gandhi International Airport is the country’s busiest airport and it can be confronting getting in and out. There is a Delhi Airport Express metro which takes 25 minutes to get to New Delhi, for INR60. Other options are taxi, Uber or Ola. Taxis are either airconditioned “radio taxis” or the standard yellow and black ones, which you pre-pay at a counter inside the terminal, costing INR500-700 to the city centre. Once in town, the easiest way to get about is by yellow and black taxis which you flag down, or Uber. You could also take an autorickshaw — the legal maximum fare is INR25 for the first 2km and 8 per subsequent kilometre, luggage is extra. The metro is quick, but avoid at peak times. You can get a one-day tourist travelcard for INR100. TAXI SCAMS There are a few taxi scams to watch out for, particularly when you are tired on arrival. Drivers may tell you your hotel has closed down or doesn’t exist and take you to another one (on commission). Tourists looking for the International Tourist Bureau at the train station will be told it has closed and taken to a travel agent to make",2

Delhi city tour … on the metro,"Quick, air-conditioned and cheap, Delhi’s new metro is the smart way to take in the history, colours and flavours of this vibrant city. We alight at the 10 key stations Top 10 things to do in Delhi: readers’ tips Delhi is celebrating its economic rise with gusto. Its silvery, sleek new metro system, in its latest stage of expansion, makes the city a much more straightforward place to visit, allowing passengers to zip about in air-conditioned comfort, avoiding its notoriously polluted and congested roads. Unlike the world above, Delhi’s metro is quiet, clean, calm and incredibly cheap: 100 rupees (about £1) loaded on to a smart ticket should be enough for four days of sightseeing. You’ll need to pay extra for rickshaws from stations to outlying attractions, but, at an average of 40 rupees (40p) a ride, that is unlikely to break the bank. The main line of interest to visitors is the north-south Yellow line, which whisks you between the city’s tourist attractions, from Mughal bazaars and forts, to cutting-edge art galleries and fusion restaurants. The metro has some wonderfully Indian idiosyncrasies: passengers are reminded not to ride on train roofs; sari-clad women are advised to use the stairs, lest their silks get trapped in the escalators – and urged to use the ladies-only carriages to avoid rush-hour groping. Outside entrances, troops of monkeys await food donations from commuters. Security is tight, with a bag check and body scan at each ticket gate, often supervised by gun-toting officers. The penalties for misbehaviour are severe: blocking the train doors, for example, may see you jailed for four years. But, as long as you remember to keep your elbows in and resist the urge to climb on the roof, the metro system will keep you safe and sane in one of the world’s most frenetic cities. Here is our guide to the 10 best stops. This stop deposits you in clean, calm imperial Delhi, a gentle, culture shock-free introduction to the city. You emerge on Rajpath, Delhi’s most impressive boulevard, with the mighty arch of India Gate, a 1931 war memorial designed by Edwin Lutyens at its head. Flanked by lawns and monuments, this is the site of Delhi’s passeggiata, and at sunset, candy floss and ice-cream sellers, bubble blowers and henna artists set up stall. Museum lovers are well catered for: the National Museum, Crafts Museum and Gallery of Modern Art are all a walk or a short rickshaw ride away. Off the standard tourist trail is Purana Qila, Delhi’s oldest Mughal monument, where 100 rupees will buy you half-an-hour’s pedalo ride on a beautiful boating lake in the shadow of the citadel’s walls. Two stops further south will take you to the Gandhi Smriti Museum, where Mahatma Gandhi spent his last days and was assassinated in 1948. The museum is a comprehensive record of his life, displaying photographs, quotes and video footage, along with the few possessions he left behind, including his trademark spectacles. Following in his last footsteps",0
The 70-day bus trip from London to Delhi that passes through 18 countries,"The first journey should be in May if all goes according to plan Get FREE email updates for West London We have more newsletters Get FREE email updates for West London We have more newsletters Hopping on a Megabus from London to Newcastle is a daunting experience for many of us, but imagine getting on a coach from London...and ending up in Delhi. This is what one tour company, Bus To London, is offering daring tourists who may wish to travel unconventionally to India's capital. The trip lasts 70 days, taking you through 18 countries during that time and amassing a grand total of 20,000 kilometres. I sure hope they have more than one bus driver for the journey. Given the current travel restrictions, the ambitious trek isn't currently active but is looking to start from May, which means the journey would last till August. Here's the route the bus will take: Days 1 to 16 will be a gargantuan journey from London ending up in Moscow, Russia. Along the way you will stop in various European cities including Brussels, Frankfurt, Prague, Warsaw, and Vilnius. The next leg of the trip will see the bus cross Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan). Following that, tourists can immerse themselves in Chinese culture for over two weeks as the bus passes through various Chinese cities like Dunhuang and Chengdu. The penultimate leg passes through Thailand, Myanmar and will take you to Imphal, a state in North-eastern India but closer to Bangladesh. Those who wish to add a few more stops to the epic route can stop in Kohima, Gulawati, and Lucknow before reaching the final destination of Delhi. Bus to London is the brainchild of Guinness World Record Holders Sanjay Madan and Tushar Agarwal, Founders of Adventures Overland. Their website states how they have already taken many road trippers on countless expeditions all over the world, visiting high altitude mountains, rainforests, isolated deserts, futuristic highways and scenic routes and that this is a new venture. Their previous long voyage type holiday was the inverse journey from India to London, where people took their own cars and drove them across the continents. This journey from London to India won't be carried out in an old banger either. The website describes the vehicle as ""a modified luxury bus offering exceptional comfort and facilities."" Here are some photos of the inside: The company promise ample legroom, an individual entertainment system with AUX and USB port, Wi-Fi, private lockers for valuables, storage for smaller bags and enough for two full-sized suitcases, a mini pantry with cool box for storing drinks and snacks, partition between seats for privacy, and first aid kits. They even have ready-to-eat Indian food packets and a portable stove. There'll be a maximum group size of 20 people so the bus isn't too congested. For a shorter trip, you can join the journey for one of four legs, each lasting two to three weeks. Fancy going? A key thing to note is that",0

Delhi by Metro | 15 tourist destinations in three days !,"Delhi Metro, the country's largest metro system will take you to each and every look of the capital city with ease and comfort. Having arrived by flight, I took the Airport Express line of the metro from IGI Airport station in terminal 3 which brings you to the city centre in just 20 minutes. If you are arriving in Terminal 1 or 2, you can take the metro from the new Terminal-1 IGIA station (Magenta Line). I checked into my hotel in the morning at Paharganj, a busy market area that is filled with a number of hotels and restaurants attracting both domestic and foreign tourists. The neighborhood is advantageous for all tourists since it is situated in Central Delhi with its main bazar road having the New Delhi Railway station on its east and RK Ashram Marg Metro station on its west end. So, area suggestion for budget travellers: Paharganj! The plan, metro and blog overview I visited Delhi for the first time this year for 3 days and slotted another day in between for Agra. The ideal time to visit Delhi is August-October and February-April so as to avoid the city’s extreme weather conditions. Delhi Metro is one of the ten biggest metro systems in the world spanning over 300 km with 8 colour coded lines. If Phase IV expansion happens as planned, it will become the 3rd biggest metro system. Although it has eight lines, all the famous tourist attractions can be covered by the Yellow and Violet Line itself. The entire blog has been written in a chronological order and all the locations are put-up in an order of comfort as it was planned and done after taking into consideration of all the locations, distances and the metro stations. The sub-headings are to be read as Time: Location Name – Metro Station Name (Metro Line Name). So, what are we waiting for? Let the journey begin! DAY 1 The first day can be covered entirely on the busy Yellow Line that connects Samayapur Badli in North Delhi to HUDA City Centre in Gurgaon, south of Delhi. 11.00 am: Rashtrapati Bhavan – Central Secretariat (Yellow/Violet Line) 02.00 pm: Qutub Minar – Qutub Minar (Yellow Line) Although the station is named after the monument, it’s a couple of kilometres away and you would have to take the bus or preferably an auto to reach the Qutab complex. The towering minaret which was constructed storey wise by different dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate is only one of the principal attractions in the complex. The Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, an incomplete Alai Minar, the iron pillar of Delhi and a few other monuments constructed by various empires make you wonder about the importance of the area in Indian history. 05.00 pm: Tomb of Safdarjung – Jorbagh (Yellow Line) A 5-minute walk from the Jorbagh metro station lies the Tomb of Safdarjung, the tomb of the finest statesman under the Mughal empire.

I was on a multi-city tour of India to document the newest food tours from our friends at A Chef’s Tour. Delhi was my last stop. I was unfamiliar with India at the time so they helped me choose all my hotels throughout the trip. For convenience, they recommended hotels that were close to the general area where their tours would take place. They did that in every city except Delhi. According to them, the site of their food tour – Chandni Chowk – was too crazy. Located in the heart of Old Delhi, it was a dizzying cacophony of sights, sounds, and smells that may have been a bit much for a first-time traveler to India like myself. And they were right. The old town was indeed crazy, but it was also perfect – a perfect glimpse into this kaleidoscopic city and country that was every bit as colorful and captivating as it was chaotic. Welcome to Delhi.

Itinerary for 3 Weeks in India,"Join my monthly email! Sign up Home » 3 Weeks in India Itinerary: Delhi, Kerala, Goa and Mumbai I went to India in April – a place I’d dreamed of visiting for years. As you’ll know if you followed along I had a few issues, but with the benefit of hindsight my 3 weeks in India were brilliant. Every day was something different, the people were lovely, the trains were an adventure and I was lucky enough to sample India in style with some awesome hotel. This 3 week India itinerary is a great introduction to a country that will seem even bigger once you’re in it. There’s a lot to see in India! I wanted to write this post to show you my route from start to finish, with recommendations of what I did or didn’t do along the way. I’ve covered transport, hotels, food recommendations and things to do. If you’ve got three weeks in India, I’d definitely recommend Delhi, Kerala, Goa and Mumbai. Here’s why… Delhi > Golden Triangle > Kochi > Alleppey > Goa > Mumbai I arrived in Delhi and got a taxi from the front of the airport to my hotel. Whatever a taxi driver states as the price in India, you need to half it to get somewhere near a fair price. I knew that already yet I fault like my offer of 500 rupees (£5) was still far too generous as he jumped at the chance. My taxi journey was so sketchy. I’d arrived in Delhi late and already booked into the Airport Hotel Metro Tower, apparently 10 minutes away but I didn’t have the exact address. The taxi driver told me he knew where it was, turned out he didn’t, and neither did his mate who’d jumped in the taxi with us. It was so scary, and the hotel wasn’t much better either. I barely slept. India tip #1: If you’re gonna be spending any amount of time in India, let alone backpacking India for 3 weeks, quickly learn that a head wobble means yes even though it looks like a maybe, not sure, kinda. It’s super confusing and can easily lead to situations like this. I pretty much ran out the hotel and into my Tripzuki driver’s arms when he came to pick me up for my tour. We went straight to the Rose Hotel in Haus Khaz (now shut down!). It was a dream and I loved Haus Khaz as soon as I saw it. It was the cricket final so my driver took me out for some Choley for breakfast (a spicy chickpea mix) in front of the TV – a definite when you’re in Delhi. The guide arrived an hour later and off we went for a full day of exploration to see a few of the must see sights of Delhi. The taxi driver added a few extras on the bill when I arrived back at my hotel, which I soon found to be standard in",0

I fell in love with Indian food after my first taste of butter chicken and naan bread over twenty years ago. I was attending university in Washington DC at the time, and my friends and I would have dinner at this small Indian restaurant called Aditi along M Street at least once or twice a month. It was our favorite restaurant in DC and we would always order the same thing – butter chicken, naan bread, and basmati rice. We’d wash it down with Kingfisher beer and finish our meal with a cup of coffee, maybe an order of gulab jamun. Good times. I didn’t know it then, but the type of Indian food I came to love actually hailed from a specific part of the country – the north. Only years later did I learn that the rich buttery curries and charred puffy flatbreads that left me with so many delicious college memories were staples of north Indian cuisine. It had become a dream of mine to enjoy authentic curry in northern India, which is why this stop at Delhi was the one I was most excited about on this three-city India food tour with A Chef’s Tour. I looked forward to eating butter chicken at its birthplace and learning more about this regional Indian cuisine that had become one of my all-time favorites.

Delhi","Top Destinations In Uttarakhand Top Destinations In Delhi Top Destinations In Himachal Pradesh Top Destinations In Maharashtra Top Destinations In Sikkim Top Destinations In Goa Top Destinations In Kerala Top Destinations In Gujarat 05 Apr 2022 0 Post a Comment The year 2022 is a revenge travel year with people making their holidays at every possible long or short weekend to complete their 2 years non travelling gaps. We are one of them with missing fun of family trip altogether. After a 3 years gap, we get able to travel together to my childhood dream destination- Nainital. To add a little adventure, we have added Jim Corbett Jeep Safari tour to it. Nainital located on foothills of Kumaon mountains is best gift of God blessed with natural splendour and enchanting views. Just name of it create a sensation of dreamy holiday inside everyone. (at least for the first time) while Jim Corbett is best for wildlife lovers with a jeep safari in dense woods spread in large area just 2 hours away from town of Nainital. So, to begin with, it was a weekend plan just after Holi extended with one day leave on Monday. We started our journey on a beautiful Saturday morning by 9 am from our residence in Delhi hopping on a 7-seater car. The brief details about the trip are as given below: Trip type: Family Trip Approx. Expenses on Entire Trip: 40,000 INR inclusive stay, food, Activity charges, Jeep Safari, Private Car, Govt Taxes, Sightseeing Duration: 3 Days 2 Nightsthe Travel Company Name: Progressive Tour & Travels As I personally love to travel more and more to explore the new attractions and best thing of any place, I had a new view of exploring Nainital that may differ from many travel authors. This article is completely my perspective about the most awaited trip of my life. Nainital is most commonly known as hill station to get respite from scorching heat of Delhi. But the dramatic changes in nature have also changed the weather of Nainital in some perspective. We felt a little warm temperature in daytime that made our mood little off to travel in perfect weather, but evening is cooler that made our stroll on Mall Road enjoyable. Let’s start the day wise trip details of my family trip to Nainital & Jim Corbett National Park. As I told earlier, we make our departure at 9 AM in the morning on Saturday leaving home after light breakfast. We take the route of Meerut expressway-Muradabad-Ramnagar from Delhi. We had a lunch break at Shiva Restaurant on Highway. We arrived at our pre-booked resort by 4 PM (near to Ramnagar). The resort was having nice ambience laden with ample of fruit trees. We get freshen up and had tea, snacks and rest for half an hour. Afterwards, we came out of our rooms by approx. 5 PM to have sightseeing of local attractions of Jim Corbett. 1.1 Corbett Sightseeing Tour At first, we headed to Garija",1

"Ricky Ponting, Sourav Ganguly Left Fuming After Confusion Over IPL Rule. 
Explained","The IPL 2024 match between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals on Thursday saw a break in match proceedings due to a confusion over tournament rules regarding the use of a foreign player as a substitute fielder. DC head coach Ricky Ponting and director of cricket Sourav Ganguly were seen having a chat with the fourth umpire when RR decided to field Rovman Powell as a substitute fielder. RR started the match with three overseas players - Jos Buttler, Shimron Hetmyer, and Trent Boult - and decided to bring Nandre Burger as their impact player in place of Hetmyer.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(""script"");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, ""//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js"");However, controversy erupted when they brought Rovman Powell on as a substitute fielder and the DC camp pointed out that it means that RR ended up using five overseas players in the match.A look at what the IPL rules say -RULE 1.2.5Each team may not name more than 4 Overseas players (as defined in the IPL Player Regulations) in its starting eleven for any match. RULERULE 1.2.6A team may not have more than 4 Overseas players on the field of play at any time during any Match. Thus, if the team names the maximum 4 Overseas players in its starting XI, an Overseas player may only take the field as a substitute fielder if the player that he is replacing is an Overseas player. If the team names less than 4 Overseas players in its starting XI, Overseas players may only enter the field of play as substitute fielders to the extent that by doing so, they do not take the total number of Overseas players representing that team on the field to more than 4.Riyan Parag smashed a 45-ball 84 not out as Rajasthan Royals defeated Delhi Capitals by 12 runs.Sent in to bat, Parag hit seven fours and six sixes on way to his highest IPL score as RR recovered from 36 for 3 in the eighth over to post a challenging 185 for 5.Advertisementvar VUUKLE_CONFIG = {apiKey: 'e6741053-104a-43d2-8bd8-b2536529f5cd',articleId: '1',comments: {enabled: false},emotes: {""enabled"": false},powerbar: {""enabled"": false},ads:{noDefaults: true}};(function() {var d = document,s = d.createElement('script');s.async = true;s.src = 'https://cdn.vuukle.com/platform.js';(d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);})();In reply, opener David Warner made a 34-ball 49 but DC crumbled under pressure with the bowlers producing a clinical display.Tristan Stubbs (44 not out) tried his bit but it was too little too late.Nandre Burger (2/29) and Yuzvendra Chahal (2/19) picked up two wickets each.

"Sanju Samson's Bold ""Indian Cricket"" Remark On Riyan Parag's Resurgence","Architect of Rajasthan Royals' win over Delhi Capitals, young batter Riyan Parag on Thursday revealed that he was not well for the last three days and had to take painkillers to recover in time for their IPL match. Considered a precocious talent, the 22-year-old from Assam finally came off age as he slammed a blistering 84 not out off 45 balls to set up a 12-run win for Rajasthan Royals against Delhi Capitals.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(""script"");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, ""//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js"");""I have worked very hard, the last 3 days I was in bed, I was on painkillers, I just got up today and I'm very happy,"" said Parag, who was adjudged the Player of the Match, during the post-match presentation.Despite his talent, Parag struggled to live up to the expectations and had underwhelming numbers to show in the last few seasons but his hard work paid off as he hit his highest IPL score to lift RR to 185 for 5.""(Emotions) They are settled, mom is here, she has seen the struggle, the last 3-4 years,"" he said. ""I know what my opinion is about myself. That does not change regardless of whether I get a zero or not.""He played as a finisher in the earlier editions but this time, the team management gave him an extended role at No. 4. Parag was also coming into the season after scoring loads of runs at the Deodhar trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s.""That's a lot to do with the type of season as well, I had a great domestic season and that helps,"" he said.""Someone in the top four has to play the 20 overs, the wicket was keeping low and stopping, in the first game Sanju bhayya did it.""Advertisementvar VUUKLE_CONFIG = {apiKey: 'e6741053-104a-43d2-8bd8-b2536529f5cd',articleId: '1',comments: {enabled: false},emotes: {""enabled"": false},powerbar: {""enabled"": false},ads:{noDefaults: true}};(function() {var d = document,s = d.createElement('script');s.async = true;s.src = 'https://cdn.vuukle.com/platform.js';(d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);})();Parag's performance also impressed his captain Sanju Samson.""Riyan Parag has been a big name in the last few years. Wherever I go, people ask me about him. There is something very special he can give to Indian cricket,"" Samson said.RR had a disastrous start as they were 36 for 3 in the eighth over but Parag slowly constructed his innings before accelerating in the end to lift them to a good total.""The way we started, the first ten overs, we were like Rovman, be ready you might have to bat! The IPL is changing and we all have to be flexible,"" Samson said.Advertisement(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement('script');ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, '//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv-v1/vdo.ai.js');RR's decision to bring in Nandre Burger as an impact player, replacing Shimron Hetmyer also reaped dividends as the South African pacer struck twice in the fourth over.""Earlier it was about 11 players, now it is about all 15 players. Me and Sanga had a lot of chat between 15th and 17th over before deciding the Impact Player. It's all about gauging in which zone they are. You have to look at that and take your decision.""I saw Sandy (Sandeep Sharma) was calm and Avesh (Khan) was also looking good,",1

Premier League (IPL)","🏏IPL 2024 match 9: Rajasthan Royals vs Delhi Capitals, Jaipur 🏏 Credit:WildestDreams Tags credit:Sutapasima Rishabh Pant-led Delhi Capitals will look to register their first victory when they lock horns against Rajasthan Royals in match 9 of the ongoing Indian Premier League, which is scheduled to be played at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. DC have lost their opener clash against Punjab Kings and are currently eighth in the points table. On the other hand, Rajasthan Royals will be confident when they face DC because they will be playing on their home ground. Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav will be a threat to Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson. Jos Buttler will look to find his mojo back while playing against Delhi. His form will be a major concern for the Royals. If we take a look at his last three outings, he just scored 11 runs, which includes three ducks. Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson will be the player to watch out for during this clash, as he scored 286 runs in 14 outings against the Capitals, and he will be more lethal on his home ground. For Delhi Capitals, it's not their jersey colour that's attracting as much attention as the return of their captain, Rishabh Pant. Batting, handling 'keeping duties and leading the side on his return to competitive cricket after a year and a half, he is expected to be their messiah following their disappointing run last season in his absence. All eyes will be on Delhi captain Rishabh Pant because he has scored four 50s in 9 innings against Rajasthan Royals with a strike rate of 170. He enjoys facing Royals, a team against whom he has had tremendous success in the past. But is there enough in Pant to cover up for all of DC's inadequacies? If the dominance of 2020 and 2021 promised DC the elusive trophy in the near future, the performances of the last two seasons have witnessed a freefall. They have lost 10 of their last 15 games, and are plagued by injuries, unavailability and indifferent form, despite several experiments, the team management are far from finding a fix. Pant's absence may have been a key missing link in DC's fragile middle-order last season, but it seems to be just as vulnerable right now. With their insistence on retaining the opening Australian combination of David Warner and Mitchell Marsh, their middle order continues to wear a thin look. Abhishek Porel's explosive innings in the previous game would have given them some reasons to be delighted, but the burden on him along with Ricky Bhui, Axar Patel and Sumit Kumar is way too much to marshall the middle and lower-middle order with only a returning Rishabh Pant and yet-to-fire Tristan Stubbs.

Jaipur","Listen to Story Rajasthan registered their second straight win in the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League, beating Delhi by 12 runs at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Thursday, March 28.

The match saw Parag score an unbeaten 84 off 45 balls to register his third half-century in the IPL and his first since IPL 2022. This was Parag's highest score in the IPL, which took him into the top-two run-scorers in IPL 2024. He only trails Heinrich Klaasen of Hyderabad (143 runs) in the race for the Orange Cap. Rajasthan took some bold calls in the game, sending Ravichandran Ashwin to bat at number 5, which paid off as the veteran spinner smashed a 19-ball 29. IPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule The start of the second innings was also intertwined in drama as Delhi head coach Ricky Ponting complained about Rajasthan fielding with an extra overseas player. Rajastahn brough in Nandre Burger in as an Impact Player, while already having Trent Boult, Shimron Hetmyer, Jos Buttler and substitute fielder Rovman Powell on the field. Despite getting off to a flying start in their 186-run chase, Delhi failed to up the ante in the death overs to succumb to their second straight loss of the season. RAJASTHAN vs DELHI: AS IT HAPPENED Pant won the toss for his side and opted to bowl first in Jaipur. Mukesh Kumar got Delhi off to a dream start, getting rid of the dangerous Yashasvi Jaiswal in the second over itself. Soon skipper Sanju Samson and hard-hitting opener Jos Buttler followed Jaiswal back to the pavilion with Khaleel Ahmed and Kuldeep Yadav providing the breakthroughs. In a surprise move, Rajasthan promoted veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin up the order, sendinh him to bat at number 5.

Sonia Gandhi is a Rajya Sabha MP from the state. Gehlot said that people have become unhappy and angry with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said that during former PM Indira Gandhi's tenure, Congress government lost due to an undercurrent. ""The party had then lost on all the seats in north India.

He alleged that his helicopter was not given permission to take off while going from Churu to Bikaner on Wednesday. ""Under compulsion, I, Ashok Gehlot and Govind Dotasara had to go to Bikaner by road. By adopting such tactics they are trying to stop Congress,"" he said alleging that the electoral bonds were tactics of dishonesty.Responding to reporters' questions, party state president Govind Singh Dotasara said that Sudarshan Singh Rawat has been given ticket from Rajsamand, but he sent a letter citing personal reasons for his inability to contest. He was busy abroad in connection with business for two consecutive months, Dotasara said adding that the high command will be informed about this matter.

"Amber Fort to Chittorgarh Fort: List of some oldest captivating 
architectural beauty in Rajasthan","New Delhi: Rajasthan, a northern state of India, is known across the globe for its glorious history, cultural beauty and vast terrain region. The state is gearing up to mark its foundation day on March 30. The state was earlier known as Rajputana and became Rajasthan on March 30, 1949. Since then, the state annually observes its foundation day on March 30 and plays homage to the strong willpower, valour and sacrifice of the people of Rajasthan by organising numerous events. While the state is gearing up to mark its 75th foundation day on Saturday, let’s take a look at some oldest monuments in Rajasthan. The table mentioned below sheds light on some oldest and grandest architectural beauty of Rajasthan. The engineering marvel is the reflection of a powerful kingdom that has ruled the area for years. Located on a scenic hill in Jaipur, popularly known as the pink city of India, the Amber Fort was fabricated in the 17th century and is one of the most beautiful historical monuments in Rajasthan. Constructed on the order of Raja Man Singh, the king of the Amer region, the fort is also known as Amer Fort and is situated just 11 kilometres from Jaipur city. Designed with a combination of white and red sandstones, the fort is magnificent architectural splendour in the pink city, attracting hundreds and thousands of visitors from across the globe. Constructed by Raja Sawai Jai Singh, a Rajput ruler of the Amer region, the City Palace is another historical architectural beauty of Rajasthan. Nestled in the heart of the pink city of India, Jaipur, the fort is a royal abode where royal families still live and stay. It is stated that there is a huge silver pot in the palace premises, which was used by the former king to carry the holy water of Ganga while he used to travel abroad with his other ministers and soldiers. Jantar Mantar, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site monument, is also situated in the complex of the palace. The Chittorgarh Fort, which was believed to have been constructed by Chitrangada Maurya constructed in the 7th century, is one of the oldest and most beautiful monuments in Rajasthan. The fort, which narrates several tales of heroism and bravery of the Rajputana warriors, has been listed as the UNESCO World Heritage. This grand old fort has seven gates and several other palaces to explore including a three-storied white sandstone Rani Padmavati Palace. Perched on a 590 feet tall hill, the fort is situated on the banks of the river Berach and is considered one of the largest forts in India.",0

Is Jaipur Development Authority bowing before 'sweet-treats'?,"Jaipur: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) is seemingly bowing before Shankar Mishthan Bhandar located at Gandhi Nagar turn on Tonk Road where three floors were illegally constructed above the ground floor of Shankar Mishthan Bhandar. Apart from this, illegal construction was also done behind this establishment. The JDA had sealed the upper three floors and the illegal construction at the rear on 8 November 2019. However, later on the order of JDA Appellate Tribunal dated 6 September 2022 and under the order of 14 July 2022 issued by the state government, this illegal construction was exempted from sealing for a period of six months on 21 March 2023. According to the order of the state government dated 14 July 2022, a condition was put for opening the seal wherein all illegal constructions should be removed within the next 2 months. But even after 4 months the illegal construction has not been removed. Government order says that if illegal construction is not removed within the stipulated period then JDA will seal this construction again and the cost of sealing action will be recovered from the builder only. And after this, prosecution proceedings will be taken against the builder in the concerned court in the next 30 days. It is clear in this order of the state government that disciplinary action will be taken against the officer who does not follow the order. But JDA officials, it appears, do not even care about this order of the government. First India is Rajasthan's own English Newspaper.

"A new museum in Jaipur trains the spotlight on 2,000-year-old art of 
minakari enamelling","It has been set up by jeweller Sunita Shekhawat, curated by scholar Usha Balakrishnan Jaipur is always a good idea. Those who have visited the city come back often. The lure of staying in a haveli hotel is unmatched, more so since the ones in Jaipur are rather economical. Moreover, it is unarguably the biggest home for arts and crafts in India ever since 1727, when the then monarch of Amer, Sawai Jai Singh II, founded the city using vastu shastra (principles of design) and shilpi shastra (principles of the arts) to build the world’s most beautiful city. He even invited artisans and craftsmen from across India—jewellers, painters, silversmiths, carpet weavers, dyers and printers—to make Jaipur their home. The tradition continues. The most beautiful of everything in India is almost always found in Jaipur. It is thus one of India’s most popular tourist hubs and, thanks to its growing industry being Rajasthan’s capital, has a large expatriate population. The current ‘maharaja’, so to speak, Padmanabh Singh, from the former royal family, is doing his best to boost foreign tourism here. His mother, the beautiful Diya Kumari, is tipped to be the next chief minister after the upcoming assembly elections. Sunita Shekhawat is a well-known jewellery designer based in Jaipur. To celebrate her 25 years in the business, she put together The Museum of Meenakari Heritage (MOMH), which opened this week in the Pink City. “I wanted to be able to give back to the city that has given me so much,” Shekhawat says. Her children, Niharika and Digvijay, are also rather hands-on with their mother’s enterprise. “The museum is truly a vision of the people, for the people and by the people,” Shekhawat says. The museum has been curated by the well-regarded scholar, author and jewellery historian Dr Usha Balakrishnan, whose mastery of story-telling and research is evident on the walls just as Shekhawat’s mastery in enamelling is showcased in the jewellery. “I had approached Dr Balakrishnan for the ground floor space, and she suggested using it as a private gallery. As designers, we are very dependent on artisans, people need to see the beauty of what they can make with their hands from up-close, and understand the importance of their craft,” Shekhawat says. We are lucky to have a walk-through tour of the gallery with Dr Balakrishnan herself. “Sunita has revived the art of minakari so beautifully, I thought it would be appropriate to tell the history of the art here,” Dr Balakrishnan, wearing a handloom sari and her grandmother’s ruby-encrusted hair ornament, tells me. Minakari enamelling is more than 2000 years old, there's evidence of it in Greece, Mesopotamia and Etruscan cultures. Then it went through a lull and died out in Europe; it was revived in the Byzantine period again, during the Ottomans. But in India, in the excavations of Taxila and Sirkap, two enamelled necklaces were discovered which are now in the national museum. One is white and the other is light blue enamels. This was",0

Gemfields Emeralds Auction Fetches $17.1 Million At GJEPC's IRGSS In Jaipur,"Gemfields said its auction of commercial quality rough emeralds at the 9th India Rough Gemstone Sourcing Show (IRGSS), organised by the GJEPC, in Jaipur, from 5th to 23rd March 2024 realised total revenues of $17.1 million. Of the 43 lots offered for sale, 40 were sold (93%) at an average price of $4.45 per carat. Adrian Banks, Gemfields’ Managing Director of Product & Sales, commented: “We are pleased to conclude another successful Kagem auction, demonstrating that the commercial-quality emerald market remains in good shape and prices achieved are broadly in line with the September 2023 commercial-quality auction. This auction offering included large quantities of lower-quality emeralds which would normally be sold to smaller manufacturers in Jaipur via our direct sales channel. These parcels accounted for 55% of the auction by weight, resulting in the lower overall dollar-per-carat figure realised at this auction. The three unsold lots were also not typical auction grades, being one large cluster of low-quality crystals and two lots of ‘Fines’ comprised of small-size material. “We now look forward to our next higher-quality emerald and mixed-quality ruby auctions to be held in Bangkok over May and June 2024.” The auction lots were made available for private, in-person viewings by customers in Jaipur. Following the viewings, the auctions took place via an online auction platform specifically adapted for Gemfields and which permitted customers from multiple jurisdictions to participate in a sealed-bid process. The 47 auctions of Kagem gemstones held since July 2009 have generated $1,006 million in total revenues, reaching the $1 billion mark.

Sunil Sharma","Home » INSIGHT » ‘Shashi Tharoor was ready to attend a session of Jaipur Dialogues’, claims Sunil Sharma Posted By: Gopi March 26, 2024 Jaipur, March 27 (SocialNews.XYZ) Former Congress candidate from Jaipur constituency for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls Sunil Sharma, who was replaced by ex-Rajasthan minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas over the 'Jaipur Dialogues' row, on Tuesday criticised party leader Shashi Tharoor, saying the Thiruvananthapuram MP should also give up his ticket as he was ready to come to the show (which has right-leaning views) to participate in a session. Sunil Sharma also claimed that Shashi Tharoor asked for five-star accommodation and a business class ticket. Tharoor had earlier slammed Sharma after he was given a Congress ticket, saying the latter was closely linked to 'Jaipur Dialogues'. At a press conference on Tuesday, Sunil Sharma said that Tharoor was ready to come to 'Jaipur Dialogues', and had even praised it. ""Now, since I have returned the ticket, Tharoor should also do that,"" he said. ""Tharoor was ready to come to Jaipur Dialogues in October 2018... he had a session with David Frawley. I am giving documentary evidence of the bargain he made. Tharoor's office asked to provide business class tickets and five-star hotel facilities to attend the programme. Sanjay Dixit, the man behind 'Jaipur Dialogues', had approved his request. ""When Tharoor was messaged, he accepted the invite and asked him to send the invitation to his office email address and complete the remaining formalities,"" he added. Sunil Sharma further said: ""By staying in Congress, I will expose those who blackmail the party by calling themselves progressive. Those who praised this organisation raised questions about me for sharing the stage."" Source: IANS Gopi Adusumilli is a Programmer. He is the editor of SocialNews.XYZ and President of AGK Fire Inc.

"RR vs DC Highlights, IPL 2024: Riyan Parag, Indian pacers star as Rajasthan 
Royals win by 12 runs in Jaipur","Rajasthan Royals vs Delhi Capitals IPL 2024 Highlights: Sandeep Sharma and Avesh Khan kept their cool under pressure to nail a few important death overs as Rajasthan Royals defeat Delhi Capitals by 12 runs at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Thursday. The result kept up the trend of home teams winning all the matches so far in IPL 2024. Tristan Stubbs gave DC hope in the end but Avesh’s last over was on the mark, as he kept it full for the most part and barely gave any hitting room. Continuing his good start to the season, Riyan Parag scored a sensational unbeaten 84* to power a struggling Rajasthan Royals innings to 185/5. After Khaleel Ahmed and Mukesh Kumar gave Delhi Capitals a sensational start, removing the dangerous Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson within the powerplay, RR finished with a very impressive total thanks to Parag’s knock and R Ashwin’s cameo. Earlier, Rishabh Pant won the toss and opted to field. The Capitals had a nightmare start to their IPL campaign last season losing five of their first games of IPL 2023 and a loss against Rajasthan will start to give them a sense of Deja vu. Pant’s addition did add value on paper however, on the field, the same batting flaws from last season were on display yet again. If not for Abhishek Porel’s heroics at the end Capitals would have ended up with a subpar total. RR vs DC recap below Keep calm and carry on In the end, the endgame mattered. The big difference was in the death overs. During RR's innings, overs 16 to 20 resulted in 77 runs and just one wicket (15.4 RPO) as Riyan Parag went ballistic. In contrast, DC managed 53/1 (10.6 RPO). Central to that was Sandeep Sharma and Avesh Khan, the two Indian pacers in RR's wonderfully varied bowling attack. One of the decisive factors in the match against Lucknow too was Sandeep's bowling in the death overs, and for the second game running, he delivered for his captain. The bowling figures might not necessarily flatter Sandeep on the night (0/36) but in the 19th over, he bounced back beautifully after going for 10 runs off the first two balls. Then with 17 to defend in the last over, it was Avesh's turn to trust his practice, stick to the plans and nail the fuller-length deliveries. RR have made it two wins in two, DC have lost two in two. Sanju Samson on his thought process behind trusting Sandeep and Avesh for the last two overs when Boult and Burger also had an over each left: 'It's all about gauging in which zone they are. You have to look at that and take your decision. I saw Sandy was calm, he had a really good game last time as well and Avesh was also looking good. So I went with them.' Here's the big difference in the end. In overs 16-20: RR scored 77/1 (15.4 rpo, 8x4, 5x6),",1

"Congress under fire for Jaipur Lok Sabha candidate choice. Shashi Tharoor 
also takes aim","Subscribe Now! Get features like Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Saturday took a swipe at the party's Lok Sabha candidate from Jaipur, Sunil Sharma, after social media users flagged his alleged association with a forum that frequently ridicules opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi. Sunil Sharma's name in the third list of Congress's candidates for Lok Sabha elections set off a social media storm on Saturday, with many questioning the party's decision to field someone who is allegedly associated with right-wing forum The Jaipur Dialogues. Most of the content posted from the official X handle of The Jaipur Dialogues is targeted at opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal. ""He must have undergone some sort of Pauline epiphany on the road to 24 Akbar!"" Tharoor said on X, sharing one of the “several dozen tweets from his handle attacking” the Thiruvananthapuram MP. In the social media post highlighted by Tharoor, The Jaipur Dialogues says, “Shashi Tharoor is just Rahul Gandhi with thesaurus he stole from a library on his way out.” A video of a reporter questioning Sunil Sharma about his alleged association with the right-wing forum has been doing rounds on social media. In the video, Sharma appears taken aback by the inquiry and rushes away after abruptly ending the interview. Sharma is yet to respond to the charges. After being chosen by the Congress high command to contest from Jaipur in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Sunil Sharma on Friday asserted that the people of Jaipur are eager to bring change in the impending election. ""Jaipur has not been able to secure its place among the top 25 clean cities in the country, which is quite painful. If Jaipur continues like this, it will not remain liveable, hence the people of Jaipur want a change. And I believe that this election will be an election of momentous change,"" he told ANI. Among other the Congress candidates from Rajasthan are Kuldeep Indora for the Ganganagar constituency, Sangeeta Beniwal for Pali, Umeda Ram Beniwal for Barmer, and Urmila Jain Bhaya for the Jhalawar-Baran constituency. The Sikar constituency has been allocated to the CPI-M. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has yet to announce its candidate for the Jaipur constituency. The Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan are scheduled to be held in two phases on April 19 and April 26. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP secured 24 seats and the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), a member of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), won one seat.
